242.1,282.8, the hardest thing about being a parent I would say is trying to give that little person so much life experience so that they don't make mistakes or so that they don't get hurt and you want to give it to them and you want them to just accept it right away but then they don't so it gets very annoying sometimes that you know what's coming and you give them the info and they don't want to take it they want to find their own way and watch them get hurt and it's sad and then they want to come in your life. I tried to tell you but you can't be mad at them because everybody learns their own way,0.9654175043106079
287.3,308.2, yeah I guess for a while when you think about it when you watch them go through their struggles it's hard to watch but it's a necessary motion of life children have to learn the way they want to learn cuz once they get it they got it so however they get it as a pair of your happy they got it,0.9501612186431885

349.3,400.1, I got there you know like Albert Einstein said it best that our technology has exceeded our humanity and there's so much technology out their kids are learning so fast it's almost like they're already little adults but they're missing the steps to being a child they missed going outside they miss learning about things naturally rather than just going to YouTube are you know wherever Facebook and in getting it so fast and they don't know what to do with all this information and they just have to fight through all that info and they it's not organic anymore children growing up these days it's not organic it's sped up its pushed and it's just so hard for them to figure out who they are in this world so that's what's wrong,0.9721808433532715
