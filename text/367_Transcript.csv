958.6,959.3, I think,0.9876291155815125
965.7,967.7, 334 years ago,0.9221733808517456
969.8,971.4, it was when I,0.9774748086929321
973.0,976.5, I had been given taking stuff for anxiety for 4,0.8731046915054321
977.5,1000.0, years before that but then I finally got a psychiatrist who actually sat down and talked to me and said you actually got this situation and we need to get you the medication that you're on is not working you need to get on this new medication that will actually start to like even you out and heal you a little bit from all this so,0.9665783643722534
1001.1,1009.8, so yeah that was that was kind of a turning point but unfortunately it happened after everything went bad so,0.9730952382087708
1019.4,1025.6, at the moment I don't know I don't really think I thought about it too much then but looking back on it I feel,0.9476308226585388
1027.1,1034.6, it really makes me angry it really makes me you know given where I am right now it makes me really angry that I'm,0.9669435024261475
1036.0,1056.7, that I had that I I lost everything because because of chemicals in my brain because of things that I couldn't control and that you know the people that were supposed to help me weren't helping me I mean I was paying I was paying a lot of money to to go see doctors and they were doing it you know it wasn't,0.9702324867248535
1058.3,1073.3, it was it didn't help it didn't work until until you know I managed to find somebody who did work and I just yeah so I'm I'm like thanks guys for helping but it was a little it's a little late now,0.9590137600898743
1086.6,1092.4, there really wasn't any choice I had to I was I was a mess I was it was either,0.9785443544387817
1094.6,1122.8, I was I was self-medicating it was affecting my work I mean it was everything was just there was a point where I really realized that I mean I just had to like make this different but again it was too late because you know then my review came up a few months later and you know after after everything after being institutionalized once or twice and and all this stuff you know they just decided that I was just not worth keeping around so they laid me off,0.9497464299201965
1124.3,1127.6, but it was at least that and not,0.9792551398277283
1129.4,1134.3, firing me but but but yeah but so I got help but it was,0.9615795612335205
1135.6,1137.1, but it wasn't soon enough,0.9876289963722229
1144.4,1147.8, not not as much as I should,0.9822046756744385
1151.1,1182.9, I go to a couple of meetings I go to I go to AA so that I can you know keep control of that aspect to 2 and there's a there's a therapy aspect that unfortunately you know being unemployed my unemployment ran out you know I'm time you know what I'm getting my medication from the city of La so you know I'm not really in a position to put money into seeing somebody so I have a psychiatrist that I go see but it's really,0.9595498442649841
1184.1,1192.2, very I've only seen her three times in the past year so basically to keep my medication coming,0.9639277458190918

1210.8,1212.3, well like I said I mean,0.9675542712211609
1215.6,1240.6, this the top I mean let's just take the AAA for example because that's probably the close closest for that I'm seeing with therapy right now just saying stuff out loud is just like getting getting the stuff out trying to figure out how to take that mess that's in your stomach and in your brain and make it into words and sentences that make sense,0.9601245522499084
1241.9,1270.4, that you can actually deal with is a big step like regardless of who you're saying it to whether it's a a therapist or just a room full of of drugs you know I mean you're you're taking all that stuff that's that's really been killing you and you're making it into something that you can deal with something that you can write down something that you can talk about as opposed to just letting it just sit there as this formless thing,0.9637573957443237
1278.8,1281.8, you know better than I that I have been I mean,0.9832606315612793
1284.0,1317.4, it is sort of a good it has its ups and downs you know I'm applying for jobs 5-6 jobs or more a day you know I never getting a response never getting an interview never even getting close to 2 to being self-sufficient again it's hard but that's like real world problems I feel like the chemical parts are getting under control like the the depression is getting under control so now it's just I have to deal with real life witches,0.9536294341087341

1400.5,1402.5, you know for that instant I felt like,0.9813315868377686
1403.7,1415.4, a normal person doing a normal thing with a pretty girl who he really really liked a lot and you know everything was going really well and,0.8848461508750916
1417.8,1427.0, I mean it wasn't going really well because it was all messed up but for that instant I felt like a normal person a normal happy person and,0.9701162576675415
1428.7,1431.0, part of what makes it so hard now is knowing that,0.9807758331298828
1432.5,1434.6, I don't know if I'll ever feel that again,0.9859189987182617

1529.5,1533.8, and there was a lot to it and so it was probably the biggest,0.9852916598320007
