213.0,238.8, the specificity of my own you know the the the given the parameters that I grew up under like how different everyone else is like how how every life is totally I mean even just within the US like seeing how someone in California grows up is so different from how someone in Maryland grows up and then to think about someone in like Thailand or something growing up it's pretty pretty amazing,0.969696044921875
246.8,248.3, okay,0.9500231742858887

278.8,321.9, I made a lot like two years ago I went on a road trip across the u.s. and that was that was pretty amazing saw but I guess the best put the best two places on the drive from Maryland to LA this is before I actually moved out here but I visited New Orleans and New Orleans was just this whole like even though it's part of the us it's like a totally it's totally different than anywhere else it's so unique the culture they are so unique and and the blend of like Caribbean in French and all these other influences into like the American South is so so yeah it's just it's it's unreal,0.9620697498321533
334.7,336.1, tough question,0.9762910008430481
339.6,340.2, what,0.8991098999977112
369.2,374.4, can you come back to that question are you capable of that,0.937463104724884
376.6,377.5, come back to it,0.9318693280220032
380.6,382.5, yeah so just that,0.876030445098877
384.8,385.2, dumb,0.8381775617599487
390.0,449.3, you know that's actually a question I've been asking myself I knew I know my entire life I've had like phases of Interest so when I was like very very very young I was really into like the first phase that I remember was keys and then tools like a girl around collecting keys and then I go around collecting tools like just every sort why the toolbox my parents have told me that I had faced before that with his balls like various balls and then I was really into like insects collecting insects and reptiles and instead like animals and then the dinosaur phase and at a certain point I got really into like rat like music like the first rap and then guitar and then acting and then it's some point in their I I I remember telling someone that right now I'm interested in playwriting and and poetry but eventually I was going to be interested in in,0.9661977291107178
450.0,493.5, film think I could kind of see the trajectory coming but I don't remember what led me to that conclusion I think I just always I would love to sheltered life as far as movies are concerned I didn't my parents didn't let me see an R-rated movie until I was like in high school of us like and and I never signed a lease on R-rated movie I was also very squeamish like I remember when I was fairly young maybe like 6 I saw Star Wars the first seen a Dark Star Wars Darth Vader cracked like brakes a guy's neck at just a little scene bear at the very very beginning and that like freaked me out and I had to leave the room so,0.965427815914154
494.7,495.5, I'm not really sure,0.9700757265090942
497.8,513.4, yeah it's it's it's I'm not exactly sure how I got into film but I've always been fascinated by like how people interact in what like you know acting and stuff something movies in general,0.9225426912307739
515.9,516.7, I am yes,0.9711834192276001
527.8,554.5, to be a filmmaker to be able to direct and put together and like I cuz I don't use that word so much cuz I think I think of it more as like I want the opportunity to put together and make movies or to make movies is probably the best way to do it to say it cuz I want you and I want involvement in all the all the processes but,0.9492810964584351
555.7,559.5, I guess the best Parable for that would be a director directing,0.9584448933601379
566.7,572.1, well it's a lot better when I'm not living with them my,0.9706805944442749

640.0,650.9, I'm not I probably we consider myself on the scheme of extraversion are on the scale of extraversion sorry I would consider myself extremely introverted,0.9263910055160522
653.5,664.6, I just I see other extroverts in just a matter who they're around there a little like strike up conversations in a fairly shy person them sort of like or inhibited person maybe,0.9450121521949768
666.6,668.2, so I like to like,0.9663553237915039
669.6,670.4, until,0.965941309928894
671.8,674.4, yeah but I'm working on it I'm working on it,0.9481528997421265
678.1,678.6, what I'm feeling,0.8052651286125183

687.1,687.8, what are you doing,0.9279816746711731
691.1,725.0, well in the past I would smoke weed but I quit smoking weed so now I do not have a glass of wine and maybe watch a movie I don't have or maybe go like depending if it's like an ant if it's if it's a worn-out sort of stress like I like then I that's what I do but if it's more like anxious type stress I might go on an intense walk don't really exercise that much but I like in a competitive Sports and hiking,0.947231650352478
730.9,731.6, pretty good,0.9542189240455627
736.4,738.1, well I always like arguing,0.8191611766815186
740.2,743.0, I wouldn't call arguing this to losing my temper,0.9081395268440247
745.3,751.6, I enjoy a vicious debate but I don't,0.9560987949371338
753.3,776.8, as long as my like cuz I won't like revert to personal you know attacks in my in my arguments I try to keep it on subject and try to explain myself as best I can which can get frustrating cuz I'm not like the best articulator of what I think one of my weekly points I would say,0.9412844181060791
778.1,782.4, but I but the last time I had a heated debate I think that was not the question,0.8994678854942322
793.0,798.3, when is the last time that happened what happened I forgot I forgot to mention that that I had a heated debate,0.8337228298187256
804.6,806.4, last time I had a heated debate,0.9837304353713989
807.9,837.0, was had a heated debate about the movie Boogie Nights I didn't lose my temper exactly but I like very extremely passionate about about that I don't think it's like that good of a movie but the two people who I was I was arguing with her saying that it was like one of the like best best movies why did they think it was the best movies,0.9651919603347778
840.9,846.3, they think that like there's something there's some sort of as I understand it they have,0.9645082950592041
848.2,852.5, they have a certain they think that the,0.9794744849205017
853.8,867.1, take all of the stories with in Boogie Nights they have their own like each of them could be their own separate stories they just think that there's a whole lake complexity of character within the movie and,0.9566157460212708
868.7,870.0, but somehow like,0.8695101737976074
874.3,877.9, what were they saying they were saying like the movie,0.9618295431137085
883.3,898.9, it's like it's like the end of an era which makes it look kind of like casino and there's this attention to detail of of the in the different character like how they how they interact in the plot kind of like,0.9570241570472717
902.7,962.7, yeah I guess I think the heated debate became about like that so from there and like personally it's not like a bad mood or anything but it's the I just don't think Dirk Diggler is like that like me meaning full of a character like I like it the way I come out I came out of the movie cuz I had seen it before many years ago night at my opinion of it is basically the same even though like I remember it like in watching it again I was able to re-evaluate it there's nothing bad about the movie there's nothing I like articulable about that sleeps has a good solid acting you know the directing is good the camera moves are cool that you know it's cool it's but but it's meat for me it was like meaningless and then two and then they were that let us to discuss the movie that I recently that I really did like his Django Unchained and they both saw that movie and they hated that movie and then there was the Sixth Street I get the heated part of the conversation came about like so in the mood,0.978135347366333
962.7,1018.2, Django Unchained you have Django and jango's like it kind of has a two dimensional character but I don't think that that necessarily takes away from what the the big the big purpose of the movie is and you have dr. King Schultz who's this who's this like his mentor character and the person I was arguing with was saying that he was intelligent and so and because he was intelligent there's no way he would have risked his life to save Django or like would have gone into this like second act where they go and they go to the plantation to deceive Django's wife excetera and and the reason for her giving that argument which like either you buy that he would do that or he wouldn't but the reason for her argument is that an intelligent person would not,0.9650235772132874
1018.9,1025.5, sacrificed himself for someone else which straight which strikes me as so like,0.8901659250259399
1028.0,1074.4, like who like she's her bit her basic argument was that like altruism doesn't it cuz it was too. I even ran type of argument altruism doesn't exist the only the only thing you can do is sit like the only thing people do is serve them self so it's not quite Iron Man but it's like the only thing that people like old people are out to serve himself which I'm not arguing that like every decision has like a mix of altruism in and something like even the most altruistic type decision there's maybe like kernels of self self interest in there but she made it sound like self-interest was the only motivating factor in an in like what but what how how horrible is your life if that's like what your ultimate,0.9565220475196838
1076.7,1089.1, hurt like if you can't like love and sacrifice for other people so let it to an extremely passionate debate and somewhat like yeah it is said that,0.9297095537185669
1090.5,1101.5, so so yeah that that I guess that's the I don't think I necessarily like lost my temper I think I'm losing my temper is being more,0.9214791059494019
1105.6,1107.9, like I just I would,0.9043083786964417
1109.1,1131.1, revert to ad hominem like attacks but I didn't like that's not maybe I was like maybe I was criticizing her worldview but I wasn't like well you're an idiot you know like it wasn't it didn't it didn't turn into abuse of any sort yeah I'm glad you understand,0.9254619479179382
1139.8,1165.7, an event or I don't know if I necessarily would want to erase anything from my memory I would say an issue that I have is not being able to remember in as much detail as I would like to remember feelings and moments not stories like my life doesn't always think together until like a coherent story it's like this moment in that moment in this moment in that moment yeah,0.9615217447280884
1167.8,1171.0, tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make,0.9779914021492004
1172.2,1174.2, the hardest decision I've ever had to make,0.963695764541626
1175.3,1176.5, ouchies,0.7846517562866211
1178.3,1180.1, could it just be one of the hardest decisions,0.9291226267814636
1197.6,1200.5, choosing between two things that it's like,0.9536744356155396
1203.1,1207.7, I guess I'm having a hard time recalling a moment where I like had to choose between,0.9695055484771729
1209.4,1213.6, two options like no there's no like Sophie's Choice type moment in my life,0.8771549463272095
1215.1,1225.5, but I but I do think that the decision cuz I lived in New York for a while I went to school in New York and the decision to leave New York after having lived there for five years was it was very very difficult,0.9434252381324768
1227.8,1273.5, and but I had to do it for money reasons and because all of my all my core group of friends were either likely were Muslim we're leaving and going other places in the world and then the one other person or as close to it was living with someone who I did not get along with it all so it's like the situation where I didn't lose either going to live with people who I wasn't his clothes with or Craigslist or or move home and I think it was a tough decision to to leave that the only way I could do it I had to justify it by saying that I would be moving back to New York with in like a month or two which wasn't which didn't end up happening but that was the only way that I could leave New York,0.9700505137443542
1280.0,1285.5, you was how hard was that or how hard is how hard was that,0.9486367702484131
1294.9,1310.8, it was it was just a very like isolating ice is also like I'd felt like previously to that time I'd fallen in love with one of my closest another one of my close very close friends and,0.9085517525672913
1313.1,1314.9, that had kind of gone extremely,0.9717665910720825
1316.5,1331.4, badly and so I wasn't on speaking terms with her and I couldn't like that whole everyone on my list of friends who was like closer to her her it was quite like her me type thing but that that was the way that I kind of,0.9490134716033936
1332.8,1338.2, saw it at the time so I didn't like you know just being socially isolated,0.9570280909538269
1342.3,1342.6, yeah,0.8600242137908936
1344.0,1348.9, how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep was recently it's been awful,0.9224315285682678
1353.3,1366.2, I like to eat so the last last night I slept for like 10 and a half hours which seems to be the length of time that I have to sleep in order to have really vivid dreams but previous to that night,0.9226478934288025
1367.3,1380.8, so last not last night but the night before last and the night before that I got four hours in 2 hours of sleep cuz I was working on sat and I would get back and either and I just like couldn't fall asleep for whatever reason it's,0.9425868391990662
1382.7,1385.7, too much Roundup energy or something I don't know,0.9329099655151367
1392.2,1395.2, tired very,0.9590175151824951

1405.1,1416.4, and I also stopped drinking caffeine like I've had like a little bit of coffee the last two days but before the last two days I hadn't had any coffee in like three and a half weeks so,0.9200669527053833
1419.3,1429.6, I guess with with caffeine in my system I'm ready to I'm ready to go without caffeine it's I'm just I'm just quieter I guess,0.9564571976661682
1430.6,1431.5, more introverted,0.9806053042411804
1437.9,1440.7, since Lake lately is in Latin,0.8895934224128723
1453.9,1462.3, changing my thoughts yeah I mean I guess when having just moved here and there is a. Of time like at the beginning where the,0.9360164999961853
1464.7,1478.2, the sheer difficulty of finding a job and finding people. They moved here cuz I have a group of friends here or couple of friends I don't have like a large number friends and the the push 2,0.9349278211593628
1480.0,1490.7, to get out there and meet people and find a job and that sort of pressure is pretty overwhelming at first and I think that I'm slowly like,0.9307160973548889
1491.6,1492.9, coming to terms with that,0.9827787280082703
1495.6,1503.5, and moving in a moving past it at but not like it's still it's still there the pressures there but I'm just you know,0.8963587880134583

1533.9,1537.6, I think the last time I felt really happy,0.9876290559768677
1539.8,1548.8, was during the writing process of salt last year I shot a movie co-wrote co-directed co-produced,0.8924619555473328
1551.1,1557.0, and that was kind of like that it still consumes my life but I think that during the,0.9583446383476257
1558.2,1571.2, writing stages of that movie in which we would like get up eat breakfast bunker down work really hard put stuff up on the thing just like pure creative,0.9207643270492554
1572.4,1576.6, energy between me and the person riding it in,0.8979414105415344
