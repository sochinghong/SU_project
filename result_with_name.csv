and litter. do you travel. i have travel domestically not internationally. seeing other places and how people live in the culture. i want to hear about one of your trips. the last trip that i went to a san diego. butt out. from childhood or as an adult. family vacations to baja in rosarito beach. can you tell me. yeah the reason why that memory comes to mind because this weekend is easter and we usually will go down to east easter spring break to rosarito baja. am i have a bachelors in communication studies. because of the open field just doesn't deal with them communication interactively but performing arts telecommunications business entrepreneurship so. no i'm not at maxey unemployed. what's your dream job. i think 200 my business that's my dream my dream job to have my own company. i would like to open something like the telecommunications area. as a business something do online online services i like to make things with my hands so my next venture with would be to create all-natural soy candles. something in that area. a mixture. mixture of shy and outgoing because i have to observe people in crowds and that's how i usually make a determination if i remain reserved remain open. i listen to like a meditation tape or i take a walk or go get a massage. fair. oh man i probably yesterday or this morning usually the argument is about me making myself clear army repeating myself twice. no usually gets the other person in trouble. tell me about a situation that you wish you would have. i redeemed a service from a mechanic who fix my transmission and i had a warranty and i wrote to the department of consumer affairs and the guy offered me a portion of the settlement agreement and i decided to take him to small claims court to get a bigger amount and i wish i would have have. taking the offer that he gave me at the midst of dealing with a third party which was the department of consumer affairs and because of that i took him to small claims court and i end up losing the whole settlement and only been offered a very small portion so i wish i would have taken the higher road to taking a lower road. i don't tend to feel guilty about too many things. tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. hardest decision. i don't know financially emotionally. emotionally letting go of past relationship the hardest thing to say the hardest thing but it was a difficult thing. can you tell me about. yes it was a relationship of 7 years but that person is already moved on. so they want me to be in their life and hopes that if something goes wrong with my current relationship will always have something to fall back on. that sounds really hard. oh yeah it is hard. tell me about your bag or something that you wish you could erase from your. in advance. so that i can trace for my memory. i don't know there's a lot of events that i just automatically erased from my memory but whatever comes to mind right. probably the death of a relative. i'm alone and misinformed. because i didn't know that they were that sick and i didn't know that they were their days were numbered. and i could have had more opportunity to spend time with them and make better a better connection in the last days. i'm sorry to hear that. tell me about your relationship with you. is fair to midland. are you into your family. my immediate i'm very close but distant not very close. okay. my mother. tell me about. and yes i she's encouraged me to continue my education to always fall back on my hobbies hopes golden dreams she always encourages me to always stay loose and out there looking for a better opportunity. and she encourages me to not be afraid to explore other ventures. how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep. easy. i've been feeling well. yes a little stressed but i'm trying to manage that. i leave the stressful environment. in the past. about 3 years ago. because i was having issues in my learning environment. and i was feeling emotionally attached. yeah i was having an issue with a professor who was just very. i know you have a very different personality. he almost ran me down the crosswalk at school. how do you feel. i felt i felt like i was in a dishonest environment i felt. like i wanted to get you know switch his class and get into another class but i had no choice but to stay in there and deal with his meanness for the whole semester. have you been diagnosed with depression. i think through finding ptsd they were trying to link depression. you still go to therapy now no. financially. i'm not capable and i haven't found a counselor who's willing and committed to working with me and helping me with my issues. i find a lot of counselors they listen to me and then they laugh at me and then they tell me the opposite of what's what i'm telling them. last time i felt really happy i really don't know that's a good question. something you did recently that you really enjoy. just just do what i want i just relaxed. i just relaxed and. you know i don't know. i don't have any best friends. my best qualities that i'm hard-working i'm reliable i'm an excellent friend. i'm energetic. and i'm going to go get her. things that i wish i could change about myself probably be less sensitive. don't take things so personally. and. learn how to help myself before helping others. no i don't have any regrets in my life. if i could do things differently 10 years ago i probably would have. focus and study more. and less. being out of the house and hanging with friends. what are you most proud of in your life. baguette have a college education and i'm self-sufficient. and. i can pay my bills by myself and. i'm alive. goodbye. hi. so then where you at that was

1,4,yeah that's perfectly fine. i'm feeling great it's an early morning i don't have school. born and raised in los angeles california. the fact that you can serve snowboard and like do to drastically different things in one day. coming from the neighborhoods i've lived in i'd say the population of. lower socio-economic backgrounds it's like a cesspool almost for young african-americans and it sucks. not really i've been to new york connecticut mexico and texas but pretty young. mostly if i'm traveling by plane just decide in the air is amazing it's remarkable. the first time i went to new york i was about 11 years old and i made sure i got the the window seat on the plane and just a feeling of taking off is just exhilarating but we left at night here in la and it was the next day in new york so it's kind of confusing getting used to the time change and the first thing i remember doing is getting a slice of new york pizza it was it was delicious. yep. graduating with the bachelor's degree in communications so i can go into the military as an officer. what made you decide to do. actually like would i don't know it's like you got to have a plan it's the only thing that's just falling into place and it seems like it's going to fall into place for me. what's your dream job. to be honest job that doesn't exist. however you can get paid to do nothing. yeah but probably. i was definitely shy as a kid but i've grown into myself through the experience of college so i'm way more outspoken. i write music and i work out mostly so if i'm feeling stressed out i just do a set of push-ups and lifting weights. i'm pretty good i saw a therapist when i was a kid for about a year. and i don't know if he told me to just be able to control my emotions and i don't think i do it in the best way because when i'm angry i do decide to like just bottled in my emotions instead of letting them out in their appropriate outlets. not really it's been more of a in interpersonal thing that's i don't know i don't know. probably yesterday something in regards to sports the playoffs are on so things like that than hu. so many. i guess in my senior year of high school i waited till the last minute to apply for the uc schools and it was unsuccessful because i didn't get to turn in applications and i'm pretty sure i would have been admitted so it sucks but hey. tell me about. that is an intriguing question. i've actually no clue. the death of my grandmother. sure. my grandmother died when i was 11 years old she raised me from the time i was born because my mother was unable to take care of me she raised my sister my brother and my cousin is well and her five children so she's the matriarch of our family and the closest thing i've had to a mother it was tough but it's going to be 7 years dismay next on the 30th and i've grown quite a bit no more tears. i'm a foster kid so i was emancipated from the foster program about 2 years ago now but my immediate family are pretty close with him as much as i can and my foster family they're awesome i've known them since i was 5 so it's been pretty cool. how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep fairly easy i fall asleep pretty quick it's not a problem except for when my back's hurting and then it's a problem. a little moody in the morning i guess i drive more aggressively. a little stressed about a few problems that i can take care of but i shouldn't stress because either can do something about it or i can't mess this way things work. can you tell me about. usher i have a few parking ticket not parking tickets are not moving violations but their tickets and i was unaware of if you miss court without being in the hospital or being in jail that you couldn't be excused from not been making your court date so i have 3 failure to appears in court with tickets that are thousands of dollars and i have no money so. i don't know if it's pretty tough to deal with when you're trying to make something out of your life but. there's so many barriers and obstacles that like you you didn't foresee so i don't know it gets stressful at times and yeah. thinking about it for periods of times some days i just sit and i'm just lost in my thoughts and i don't really communicate to anyone because there's nothing anybody can do for me early so i just bottle it up like i do everything. not very after doing it for so long it becomes a natural thing i believe. no. no. really happy why is that such a difficult question. i don't know i'm pretty content with everything right now i don't know about extreme happiness everyday is just the same day seems like. dunking across the street at the clippers center is a basketball court there and i've been working on it for a while and i finally got up yet. i have 4 close friends that i've known for over eight years each and i don't know studios hard-working. determined i don't know. yeah. probably my metabolism which i don't really have control over some i don't know i'm pretty content with myself. tell me about. i think in my sixth grade year of grade school i was i wasn't the best of students but i had a teacher who was diligent and like he felt me the whole year but i learned a lot and i developed a passion for school afterwards so it was like a situation i overcome after feeling so bad and down. the same teacher who made me feel really bad actually because it wasn't for his like sternness i don't think i would have gained the discipline to be where i am at now in college and stuff so. i remember this time i was in the desert or up in joshua tree with my best friend and his dad and we actually got stuck in the mountains and like we went down a gully and his jeep would get over a rock so it was it was pretty yes it was kind of weird and i thought i was superman i try to move a rock that was thousands of pounds didn't work but yeah we eventually got out without going to be stuck in the desert but it was a fun time i got to drive in the desert when i didn't have my license owes fun. about that day or in general. other than like the uc thing like what i didn't apply to the schools and time i regret that. i don't know i was i was 10 years old 10 years ago i probably say to myself. no clue that's that's an interesting question. bing the first from my mediacom immediate family is in my mother my brothers and my sister to go to college. so yes it's pretty. no problem.,0,0,1,0.7505908,0.24940923,,2.0,0.800000012,0.758434548,447
2,18,when it's always female. yes. i'm okay thank you. i was born in east los angeles. yes. the freedom to explore outdoors with different weather temp out with weather temperature and climate to go skiing or to the beach may be in the same day. i think probably the overcrowding and the smog. i'm sure you can tell them. not not frequently but i have. meeting other people and learning about their environment and their cultures. sure i'm the last trip i've taken outside of here was too heavily and that was my second time being there and. i enjoyed it more this time because. i knew what i wanted to say when i came back and and i was better prepared for. italians and their culturally i felt i wasn't isn't you know i was just better prepared i thought for that trip. that would be. being in the countryside and seeing a very tiny house in the mist of. acres and acres and acres of grapes with just. magnificent. human development. i actually didn't decide it first to do that i started school with the intent of being a lactation consultant and i went to a program in which you could get a degree as well as get your license to become a lactation consultant. and through the process i learned that i had to do a long internship without pay and at the time and i miss i had a family so i had to make a career choice quickly and so the college offered. human development major and i just went right in and used my use my units that i had already acquired towards that particular major in and i'm happy with it. i'm currently no i stay at home i have a little one is not so little i'm preparing to go back to work in the meantime i design jewelry. well i have three children i have almost four-year-old and then i have two older children 17 and 23. no. that your children that the love from them and for them is unconditional. all the stages that they go through their stages all the time for every age. and everybody in my household is all different because they're different ages so. i think i'm probably more in tune with those different stages that's why it makes me crazy and i think that my parents the time that my parents were parents he was just kind of like you know is she fed is she dressed as a house i mean a roof over her head and we're doing greatest parents and we love her and so it wasn't there wasn't too much i felt that that parents thought about in terms of n terms of parenting in that way and like today you know there's books for every age every year month you know and. so i think it difference differs in that way tremendously. fairy clothes. outgoing. i don't i don't feel uninhibited i feel you know confident to talk to people i probably talk. more than i need to. i bead i do i design jewelry that's what i do to relax. i'm pretty good ii. well i think i. trying not to not to feel or let others know what my emotions are when i'm upset which is not good because if i don't do anything with them then i know that some point it's going to come out and. yeah that that's something i have to work on. like exercising or something. hey with my husband and it was about. he asked me whether i thought about cheating ever in our marriage on him. i really tired of talking about that same topic. well it came it spawned from a client of my husband's who's a female and she shared with him that she'd been cheating on her husband for like a year because she resented him for many things and so he took that information and came home and decided to ask me if i ever thought about it and what made me. i think about cheating and he knows that i've been resentful of him and did that make me feel like it did that make me want to cheat or did i think about cheating and. i we've had this conversation a lot of times and i mean not just that but. i don't know just about cheating in general and so i just said what i normally said normally is that i haven't cheated in that i did think about that when we were first together and i thought it was just a mere thought and. and then his response was i know that if we cheated on each other we would never tell one another and that just came out. i guess irritated me i was really bothered by that and i just started liking you know we're having this conversation yet again and why are we having this conversation are you the one that's cheating and so that's how that that went into. that argument i mean he wasn't yelling at me and was part conversation and part texting. not talking. at all. pretty much any situation that involves my children and if i've yelled because i really don't like if i came to the point where i've had more of yelled it bothers me because. i was yelled at a lot and i just. feel bad about that and i try really hard to not. handle any kind of situation that involves my children no matter how upset i might get and results and yelling. tell me about the hardest. that would probably be whether to keep. a pregnancy or not. yeah i am. i was just talking about yesterday actually and. i'll always pregnant and i had wanted i wasn't married yet and i had wanted to be married and but i just didn't think that it was the right time for me. and i had pretty much made up my mind that i was not going to keep that pregnancy. but i made the decision by myself and when my partner found discovered that i was pregnant he said that he very much wanted to have a child and wanted to marry me. and so that decision was quite hard because i felt obligated to do so and felt super guilty to not and. and. earpiece. erica. that was probably the hardest decision actually not know i wouldn't say that's the hardest decision i've ever had to make i'm sorry the hardest decision that i had to make. in my life was whether or not. the hospital should i unplug the life life support machine for my father or not. that was our decision. because i knew that the quality of life he wanted for himself was more than that and to have been to resort to the situation that he was in not capable of doing anything at all either speaking for himself. was beyond who he was and i just couldn't see him. like that anymore and he would be a vegetable i was told. so i agreed. to amritsar.. not. hardly ever. too many things running in my mind. and pretty much mostly on the weekends because my older kids are out and about with their friends even though i. know that they're going to i mean i'm constantly worried about how they are when they come home and so i really can't fall asleep on the weekends most time but. sometimes it's just been so many days of not getting good night sleep i'm just too exhausted i pass out. but it's hard. very stressed. my son is is. has been in dealing with some legal issues and currently is incarcerated and. it's been really hard. yes i've been probably very short moody irritable. well i often think about a lot of things that aren't even happy my mind just goes from when point a to point b and i don't even know how i got there now. it's interesting. yeah. yes. about 3 years ago. my. obg suggested i i see a psychiatrist. yes. well i've in the process of changing therapist so it's been about because the program that i was in lost funding and i lost my therapist. the therapist that i was working with and so it's been. about two months maybe three now and but i did notice when i was in therapy. it was just an intricate part of my my life my week to see my therapist i really helped me cope. when i picked up my son from. when he was released. from. gel. i go get her probably you know should we use the term hustler but meaning that i'll i'm not afraid to do a lot of different kinds of jobs to do what i need to do to support my family i mean you know legally of course outgoing. maybe sometimes a little too for to outgoing for her. and compassionate. sensitive. loyal. all the things that remind me of my mother. well yelling the yelling part was when. just the little things that used to drive me so crazy i can see myself. doing them and it bothers me a lot. regarding what. not too much really i don't know. to go to college right after high school or not right. and and. that i didn't really need to be in a relationship to be happy. that are that you don't have to be in a relationship to be happy that you can certainly be successful and not in a relationship and still be happy and. live life. what did i do. i visit my son yesterday and that was really good. i was happy that he was safe. my children. and. my accomplishments in. school and work. bye. purpavis tilted back and let came off okay maybe stopping it did not get got everything

i think that's it that's it yeah that's it. what do you enjoy about. just exploring exploring new places sing new things meeting new people a different culture it's definitely gives you an appreciation for life and the diversity of it and also going to countries that may not be as adult as the usa definitely definitely gives you a greater appreciation of you know what this country. okay well let's see london i accidentally actually when i first heard about going to london i really didn't care for it cuz i know much about it the only thing i remember is watching mary poppins and but when i went there i absolutely fell in love with it just. if i have the hustle and bustle of la but at the same time you can go to very very slow pace we didn't do any driving we just went on the tube which is there are like the underground subway station which i absolutely fell in love with and just exploring different parts of the city we went to you know big ben westminster abbey they actually

resources management what that means i have no idea. the question i've always avoids want to go into business and i've always want to study finance but i didn't think i would learn too much about finance from. college purse i think i've learned more in the real world whatnot so that option was human resource in the morning fasting about you know relationships and people always like reading articles about that stuff so i went for that. well i still i still kind of use what i've learned but i i work in property management so. anything to do with people i'm fascinated about so yeah. i love

hawaii. what do you do. to relax i usually listen to music. asia listen to music to relax me or i pray. try to relax myself or listen to some really calm music so yeah. very good very very good i used to i want to say was a bad temper but i was known to. go off quot and quot not throwing chairs anything like that but. i'm a very patient person. once that patient is gone and for you to do that you have to really really really really push my buttons for a long time and once it's done i i just go off. no no. the last time i argue with someone while having argue with me long time. boy. i argued with my. no i would see my i think my dad i argued with them about. we were disagreeing on some things about when we're going to supposed to go back to nigeria. and he wasn't listening to it was kind of a group discussion myself in my my siblings and he was being very subjective he wasn't being open to other people suggest engine suggestions and concerns. so it started an argument. very. i would say angry per se but i felt very. come like i was losing control. like a mom to type while i like to be in control of my emotions in my thoughts and i feel. once that patience is gone and i start going to off it's kind of like this. yeah i'm called a blur but i'm very witty and quick with what i say so i'll instantly say something that you know. how to say hurtful but i'm very direct and to-the-point make sure i get my point across. i have three brothers one one younger to older i am very close to my family and my mom's are my best friends. my brothers are great love them to death my father and he's more thought of it picture. what's something you feel guilty about. i don't i don't really i'm not the guilty pipe i don't feel guilty i'm not one to shy away from what i've done and i

pretty easy at yeah i'm pretty good at falling asleep except when i'm excited while i'm reading from check when i'm going to focus on learning something like i'll read and read and read it when it's past my bedtime but now i'm going to work on. waking up much earlier than when i am now and it's kind of a little bit of a struggle but i'm getting to it so. i've been feeling i've been feeling fine you know i'm generally a very very happy disposition and sell. no yeah deep depressing moods nothing like that whenever if i feel do feel like i'm going i don't know allow myself to go to that place. have you been diagnosed with depression. thoughts. i would say. it's i want to say necessary changes by same or so behaviors learning how to. let go of past decisions may be that kind of how they they play their course in my life. i just said sometimes i kind of look back and say what if i did this what would have how would life be now now so that doesn't that's it. designing your. regrets no no there's anything i regret. dennis 20 years ago. i would say don't be afraid of who you are. i'm be authentic more imprinting with yourself. erased from my memory. that's a good one. restore my memory. i would say what i say oh my tell my dad that he should act like a father. maybe i should yeah there was a. that was actually one of the times i am by the time i went off with him mom basically i had decided not to go to a private not to go away for college. i want i decided to stay local so i can look after my little brother. and my senior year i was overloading with everything i had maybe like for ap classes i was working if i was working three jobs at the time and was also on track and field so needless to say i was and i'm. i wasn't doing well in ap calculus because i decide to go to a jc first and transfer also the save money for college to and when i told him you know the teacher called sing us falling asleep in class because mind you after school i work an 8-hour shift cuz i was a retail manager at the time so i come home after that ship to do homework calculus let alone so he would get upset and i told him i spoke my accounts already told him that i don't need that class to go to the jc but that's okay i'm going to continue with some just going to i can't drop out at that point in time so i'm just going to let you know. yeah i'll discuss take the dfl whatever and he didn't he didn't like that cuz he is a teacher. and so he started blaming like my jobs and wanted to call my boss and it was it was just too much and i told him yeah sure my father should act like it but i was supposed more aggressive. one thing i do remember i do regret one thing. and that is i wish i continued with college throughout. like i i i burnt myself out i'm out spreading myself too thin nails actually i was actually on track to graduate from college at wednesday 19 starting college classes in high school starting sophomore year in high school but with that that stuff enough stuff for dad and working i just kind of like stop going to school for a while just worked if i went back to finish so but maybe that's one small thing but that's something small down. yeah. i'm very i'm a very compassionate and understanding person. i like learning new things i'm a very very happy person people come to me for advice i'm very objective i'll tell you the good the bad the ugly. and yes those are my best qualities. man found a way to have fun in any situation i can make light of any situation like i'm the kind of diapers i can break the tension in the room that sort of. that sort of a. personality trait. wish i was taller. beside my heights. i wish. maybe. i don't know if it's that be more i want say be more in touch with my emotions i think i would say understanding people's how people feel about me in their shoes. i think that would be one thing because i'm the type of person wear. people say that they love me or care about me and i'm like okay great thank you i appreciate that i don't realize how much they do i think that's not realizing how much they care and love me that's one thing i would like to. get more of a grasp on. my best friend she described me as someone

here all my life. i'll let me start with both try boston i had never been to boston before and when i went i was able to look at the historical the buildings and i went to i saw the lake charles and then the boats and stuff with it it was just it was a good experience and it's another place i went to i took a ferry in it and my mind went on blank on it i can't even think of it right now but other than that new orleans i didn't go to the mardi gras just i don't like to go when it tomorrow to growl when they have a lot of people i just went on the offseason i enjoyed that and i've been to atlanta georgia. and i have taken a cruise went to the caribbeans i took mexico cruise by next cruise i like to go to the alaska because i want to be able to see certain areas that we haven't destroyed yet as far as their environmental. i'm outgoing. as far as going places i don't have a problem eating alone i don't have a problem meeting people. i'm only shy and conversing back and forth to a stranger. oh i have a favorite thing i like to go on the internet and i like to do sweepstakes i'm a person that loves to try to enter in a lot of contest and i've been very successful since i was a kid i've won a lot of sweepstakes and in the evening time i find our time and i just go online and just i'm so good at i know just about exactly the right time to even entering i usually try to answer them before midnight when everybody else is asleep so it's been successful for me. getting married having my children. i have a 27 year old son and i have a 31 year old son both of them when one of us married though it's not and i just not too long ago became a grandmother i have one grandson and my son he works for the county of los angeles assessor property conveyed convenience as amateur and the other one is the computer engineer so and i've been married for 33 years and strong. you don't want. if you build a foundation with your children and have a good relationship with them and talk to him and find out what's going on and tell them that you love them on my son i talk to him all the time when he went out the door i love you and even today when they're call me and hang up a said mom i love you you always have to give them that that good feeling when they leave the door that you care and i never had to go to head to any jail to get them out they've been pretty obedient i mean boys will be boys but i never had any problem as far as them getting into any serious trouble and i'm very proud of that especially the boys i don't know how it would have been different but. avoid if i have to say it was pretty obedient and they respect the law. the best thing is watching them grow and become parents themselves and see what they learn basically from you and i've watched my son like i said just grandmother and i watch him how he handles his son and it seems like he's learned a lot from his foundation that he learned at home on how the hell his son to be responsible to go to work every day and he knows that hey i got a wife i have a son and it's my job to make sure that i keep a roof over their heads so it tastes off. and i asked nicely he treats her well. my mother was more stricker on me but my parents for some unknown reason i guess because i have my sister and i were the girls like they weren't struck on the boys but they were more strict on the girls so they didn't let us go a lot of places and then my parents are so they weren't typed it like to travel and i used to look at them and say no i'm not going to be like that now i'm going to travel i'm not going to just stay home and i don't mean that is nothing wrong with him because they. downtown love is home and do things at home but they never really travel anywhere and my mom used she was afraid of planes for one and i used to try to talk her and get on a plane and go somewhere and she said well i'm going to go here i'm going to go there but you never did she died she never needed to do any trouble so i made up for and want to do something different in the next two to travel more than and be more out there i was more of a social butterfly my mother was not a social butterfly so i made up for it. i think before i speak and then i am the type of person also to take on other people's feelings before i blow out the wrong thing i try to analyze the situation first because sometimes you can put you open your mouth too soon and you can put yourself in something that you would not be able to get out of. it's probably something about my husband yet i know it was this new construction that my husband is working on our house. we had a disagreement on that then have their own way of doing things and i had told him not to use a certain person to work on our house but because of the personal relationship he has with this person he went on ahead and now he sees all the downfalls and he didn't listen and so i didn't say i told you so but i guess you can tell by my facial expression that he'd have done wrong and i told him i said look you losing money and it became one problem after another so now i'll do a construction thing is up in the air right now cuz he knows he has done wrong and i'll but he doesn't want to face the fact that what he knows it but he doesn't want to really face it back so he says i look smart project with our project. so i grabbed this one of the biggest arguments are we having right now that i can think of this recent. i felt that he didn't really listen to me and he more so looked at cheap or economical way that he can get this done without going through the proper ways cuz i told him that you need to do your research i'm the type of person i do my research before i jump into something i asked tried to. my eyes and cross my t's but my husband he's not like that he's fight i can get this person can do this project for x amount of money and he's a good friend of mine so i don't care i mean is he license he doesn't look at all that stuff he's he could just jumps into it. witch costumes some extra money unnecessary money that is spent on the end i mean it's a lot of money and so i was really very upset yesterday i was very upset about it because it was just wasted money that we could have say can we wind up doing the same thing all over again and it didn't make any sense. i retired early i was very fortunate to retire at age 50 i retired in 2002 i was working for the state of california disability alice and what happened was i was able to reason why i was able to retire so early because i've been working since i was 18 and i had like 31 and 1/2 years of service and we was so nice about it that i only needed the best in like 10 years in my health insurance so i was able to get full health insurance but the only thing about it when you retire i've been with kelp her and i know if you have a counter but if we have excellent retirement system and since i have been working with them so long. i didn't get the full percentage i should have stayed thomas 55 but i got out of that 50 and i didn't get the full amount but that's okay i found myself going back doing a little part time job because of the economical reason and then i have one eye that's so. i think that was the kind of mistake i did i should have kind of waited till i was 55 and 50 but i look at it now as far as the health insurance i really benefited because of the rising cost of the health insurance have went up and i don't pay very little money so i think that over the gates of the money that i receive. you see the hardest. i probably when my mom died cuz i'm not used to anybody dying and my mother died in 99 of non-hodgkin lymphoma and. putting her funeral together my brother and sister we never we will never face with anybody dying of putting a funeral together and all response because i am the eldest it was put on me and i'm like oh my god what i do is so it's kind of like trying to find her insurance policy cuz i had asked her to make sure she put everything in order and she never got to it so the hardest thing was going through her house and try to get all the stuff together and finding things you know i myself i keep my things organized time for some unknown reason she didn't have her sargon eyes and i think that was the hardest and knowing how much i have to pay cuz i had to come out of pocket on some of my stuff and i'm fortunate my mom this is interesting she had one of those small barrel insurance but she had $1000000 of accident insurance and she didn't die of course with no accidents he had. local conditions so that was something that we had to pay for the whole just about everything. yeah it was it was but now i can handle that this is something weird but since that i've learned from that so i'm i have made it available for my children that my husband died we got together and we want him getting our insurance policy. insurance policy but what do you call the bureau insurance be at that and it's just that we've had it for many many years so it's almost payday advances 10 years of pay for everything and everything and nothing that i did i've even written my own obituary i know that sounds weird so my son make one phone call that i don't want them to go through what i went through and my husband agreed that's the one thing we did agree on and he said he don't want anybody to have any problem people. i didn't tell him what to do it's already written we did a living trust it's nothing they can do but make one phone call and that's it. i have no problem sleeping very well. pretty good. i didn't a little tired but that's only because the physical condition i have found out i have vitamin b deficiency in vitamin d deficiency self is more physical but not mental. exercise walk walking more saw. no not really. no. no. i'm basically happy all the time i'm more so i'm making other people happy i get more phone calls as people want inspiration about things when they have projects they working on and then i try to encourage them and it makes me feel good when they hang up and say you know hey i really appreciate your input thanks and then they are i'll follow up on them and see how they're doing. resource person i've been described as a resource person from my supervisor to from my friends because i'm the type of person i research everything i get into just about i just don't dive into any situation i tried to look up information some i know if we have the technology here that you can get everything on the end of that but i also go back to the old school like that like even finding this place i mean i did the map google but also i love the thomas brother i never going to give up my thomas brothers map yellow pages you be surprised i don't give up by yellow pages so there's certain little things that i don't really let go i know we have technology sometimes she's going to be surprised that you can go around and find a whole lot of stuff that even though technology get you have it right at your finger but you can find things and then they say i'm more. barbie first person the most people come to me just to just look up things and i get that that's as funk about it because i like to look for stuff and find it. and that gives me satisfaction. i wish i could have stuff going up and down on my way to lose weight diet before the summer time and and then by christmas time i have what they call a yo-yo weight problem and if i can stop binging and making food my friend i think that's it's a nervous disorder i did i like to eat and but also i don't like to be overweight either cuz i have plenty of beautiful clothes at home and i can't get them on right now so i know i saw them when we go on this bench and try to lose weight for the summer time so i can get a no so nice, so it's mostly not happy with my weight. i'm sorry i didn't hear you. no not really i was ready and i can stay skinny again back on. i see you and i'll be home by 10 or 20 years ago. i would have stayed a little bit more money before i retire. instead of retiring too early. what's providence is on my life. meeting a lot of people that came in my life i got good friends i still have 15 of the best friends that i went to elementary school and in very where you can find anybody who can walk around and say they have the same 15 group of friends we were in the sorority together went to college together lived in the same neighborhood and matter fact we just had with all of us and our 6-year birthday and our high school group we put together a 60-year birthday reunions and hear all fifteen of us with the exception of one we're all alive and healthy and we keep in contact so i think it's basically keeping the same friends i think we can probably outlive me. okay. you're welcome bye bye. okay. alrighty.",0,0,1,0.7253619,0.2746381,,5.0,0.916666687,0.91244621,439
5,28,thank you. hi. okay. yes i am. i'm good thank you. originally from los angeles and my parents are from central america. yes. the weather i like that i can get to the water if i want to go to the hills or hike or just any element that want to get to i can get you. traffic busyness everybody's always in a hurry that's about it. i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer. you travel a lot when i can i have family in central america and when i can my husband and i we try to go to warm places like mexico or somewhere in the caribbean. the freedom of not having to have my daily routine and not be guilty about not doing something i said i would do if i'm at home and if i'm too far away from home to do it then i don't have anything to worry about. recently i went to honduras again that's where my family is from so sore like a it's a dual fault i get to see my family but also kind of get to be away from home so i do it by not imposing on them i visit them but i stay in a hotel so that way i can still kind of have my freedom and not feel like i'm obligated to being with them so it's more fun that way. experiences on vacation or. experience probably hawaii in lahaina and just having enough food i'm a foodie so having the pig roast it on the ground and just eating it that way it's just i've never been able to taste it that way anytime else so it's like a very memory is a deep memory for me cuz no matter what i do to my porchetta never taste like that pork in lahaina. business and that was years ago so i ended up in the marketing field so i've enjoyed i'd my business background did help me in the marketing field. my dream job. well i guess it would have to do with food i love to cook and only reason i hesitated because i love to cook but i just do it for home and friends and family if i were to turn into in if it would have turned into a job i feel as if it was just not be as joyous or i wouldn't have as much fun as i do have it you know what i have now but if i could just do it as a job and still have the fun and the joy that i have in cooking everyday now then that would be my dream job. i'm not going. depends on where i'm at if i'm wherever i'm at actually the first thing to do is just going to get a hold of myself that way i'm always in control no matter where i'm standing at and always say that i am my own piece p a p e a c e so i just kind of just take a deep breath assess my situation figure out what i can control what i can't control and then proceed from there but just sort of just kind of. breathing get a hold of myself first. i'm actually very good i'm actually very mild temper to begin with i don't really let anything agitate me and so if i do feel myself is getting hot or if i just react i just told her just like i said just do my own little self check you know i'm not a customer went off for a second but i do my own little self check and just so you know what come on now it's not worth it this person is not worth it the situation is not worth it be who you are and just stay there. introducing my husband and we were going back and forth about my relationship with my father and i was trying to get a point across to him and he was just kind of overlooking my feelings in it and i was i didn't want him to overlook my feelings and act as if i wasn't feeling the way i was feeling so i kept stressing my point in different ways and i found myself now in a debate and then that's when i pull back and said not look babe this is how i feel about it i'm not asking you to make me feel any differently i'm just asking you to acknowledge my feelings. when i got to my own conclusion i felt triumphant because the point of the argument in my mind was to clarify how i felt not for him to impose his you know he's very macho kind of manly guy i don't want him to just overshadow my feelings with his logic and so i said no as long as i have felt better because i eat i feel understood and i felt heard. i get my son comes to mind he's 22 years old and he we have a very strange relationship right now and it's okay i'm okay with it is used to be be a little bit more needy so he i think he assumed that i would just always look cook go looking for him or call for him as opposed to waiting for him to call me and i think i may be a very weird answer but i wish early on in my life as his mother i would have kind of adjusted that so that he wouldn't be so comfortable waiting for me to be the one to come and check on him he doesn't live with me he has his own place but waiting for me to be the one to come and look for him and you know i'll try to make sure that he's okay i think it's probably way more than you met but i would have thought would have done that different i would have mothered him differently along the way and released him at an earlier age meaning that i would have treated him more of an adult and then also not expected him to just kind of you know. i would have to kill the expectation in him for me to contour see him if that makes sense. i know it's not easy you have to sacrifice and beyond just physical things you have to just make sure you put your kids needs ahead of your own and i guess the second part of that answer is that it is easy once you realize that as long as they're okay you're okay so my son and my daughter they both know i love them unconditionally so my parents and has become easier the more and more i've lived in that true for i'm not expecting anything from them but then i also not expecting any disrespect so as long as we have that clear line of communication whatever else is going on falls under that category of respect. seeing them maybe make decisions that i wish they wouldn't make it could be as simple as an outfit no choice or as much as a career change but having to sit back and watch them listen to be open and then just kind of just be there in only want to talk about it but then not also also try not to manage them because i was also their age and have to remember that i didn't want to be managed and even if i made a mistake i don't want to be judged so the difficult part is watching them go through the process on their own and just sort of kind of just waiting around and luckily something major with my kids but whatever that personal downfall is just kind of being there and not having an i told you i told you so spirit on me. shuffle feeling knowing that you know i created this and all i plan both my kids so it's just it's a real it's an honor that i was able to do it as an honor that they're healthy and it's fun watching them so just kind of grow into their own and it's like they're minimis but then they're all so different than i am and so it's fun just being able to allow them be who they are and just celebrate them as they are so i'm enjoying that. wow completely my parents immigrated here from central america in the 60s i was born the year after they got here so they're their mentality was different they wanted to come and get the american lifestyle and which was not a bad thing is it that their parenting style was more about making sure we had a home making sure we had the shelter of course and food and clothes and schooling but there was not really a lot of time spent on the relationship from my mother to daughter to me as a daughter or my father to me as a daughter so i had to kind of figure it out on my own when it came to being a parent. tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had. divorcing my first husband cuz i was going to be the one that toppled that whole situation he was a good father just not a good husband to me and after 20 years i knew that i was going to be the one to say this is not working for me anymore and since i did that the domino effect was is this is not virtual it happened we ended up selling our house you know dividing up the assets and then living separately and then my kids were kind of in between for a little while and then i just made some decisions to where i didn't want to go through so much court hassle so i just did a tina turner and said just give you my name you keep everything else so it was a very hard decision by way of how it affected my kids that's all i cared about in terms of losing everything physical and and all the material stuff i could care less but it was hard because i i knew it was going to affect my kids and they were the only thing i was concerned about. my husband and i did not you know see eye-to-eye on certain things united regarding our marriage heat i didn't feel validated as a woman or as a wife and that's just who i am and those are the very areas that he didn't validate me and he just kind of saw me as a partner who was helping fund his extra-curricular is where there was his travel or or whatever the case maybe i'm not i'm not here to talk about that part of it bottom line is that whatever he was doing was outside of you know the sanctity of our home and i was tired of just you know working and and him benefiting from everything but then not being fulfilled as a woman or a wife and he wasn't prepared to change the despite all the counseling went through and i thought well this is not working for me and i have to take care of myself first and i had low self-esteem i mean i wasn't perfect i had a lot of things going on with myself and i had to learn how to love myself and i were to die in order for me to love my children and then in order for me to get the dog that i should get in return. how is your day. you know what is actually pretty easy because of the end of the day i just you know good bad ugly or indifferent whatever mistakes i'm happy that day or whatever great thing went on that day my goal in life is just to have peace of mind so when i put my head down at night i just ask myself didn't you know that i do anything but i'm ashamed of today that i cross anybody that i not do you know and i'm not being a pollyanna but i believe in karma i'm a god-fearing woman so i just want to make sure that i did everything i'm supposed to do today and if there's something i can rectify it you know i just make it a point to promise to myself to go back and rectified or at least learn from that and just not make the same mistake in another day. really good light you don't have to rough patches with the family individually like i said with my son my daughter the teenagers so she's kind of coming into her own so that's a different relationship to the opposite of me i'm actually very easy going very bohemian style she's very social very it'll just out there so i'm having to just kind of find our balance but overall it's just i won't complain i'm very happy for a very simplistic lifestyle that i just kind of foster on my own every day and i just enjoy my little mini accomplishments whether anyone sees them or not. no i haven't thanked god. no. really happy to see. that's at home and i think it was when. different things running through my head. i think with my daughter and i my teenage daughter and i came to understand understanding on our mother daughter relationship i'm not trying to be her best friend but yet doesn't mean you can't talk to me and i think when she came to me the other day just going to give me a big hug from behind me without really saying anything i really felt her just accepting herself and she accepted the fact that i accept who she is as she is so it was a very same moment i only see and i kind of knew about it but it just gave me just a happiness it nothing else could ever give me. thank you. i'm easy going i'm fine i'm just very you know a chameleon comes to mind i just kind of acclimate to it whatever situation i'm in i'm very honest i'm very real and just you know old if i have to be i'm just very adult i'm an adult woman and you know they were just described my best friend would describe me as someone that she can rely on extremely reliable i do as i say i say what i do and i just you know i don't i don't deal with bf. how to change about myself probably cosmetic things maybe i would just sounds weird that i was saying nothing nothing really. i think i would just be a little bit more aware of others i think i'm super sensitive to others but i think i would just be more aware make sure that i'm not being selfish or i'm not turning anyone out just because i want to get through my yoga i want to do something else i think i would just be more observant and aware of those around me to make sure i'm not offending anybody. i don't have any regrets that i think about that all the time and you know this is natural to go back and say if i were in that situation with the mindset i have now what would i do it but the reality is that i know that everything that has happened up to this point has shaped me so i can't you know very well take the benefit from it and then turn around and call it a regret because i know i learned from it probably sounds very textbook but that's true that's is really how i live so i believe that everything good bad ugly or indifferent happen for a reason i truly believe that and my job is to take from it what i'm supposed to take from it and take that into my future so i'm to take the you know the hard knocks with it with the joys. be real with myself that's that's one thing that took me 20 years to kind of get to just to kind of be honest with myself to embrace who i am to just you don't get to know who i am learn my own infrastructure be comfortable with the with the innate things that are a part of me don't try to read. i read that myself or try to become something that i'm not i would have still chosen the same marketing career to see if i would have still climb the same corporate ladders but i would have done it from a more internal place not that i lost myself in it but when in terms of my family life i would have just been more true to myself and that way i would have had any kind of resentments. my family my my role as a wife my role as a mother i think that ultimately that's where my main fulfillment comes from because no matter what at the end of this life this life of in this body and this vehicle. i mean i'm going to do or i'm going to be as an epitaph and somewhere in a cemetery. and i'm always just true to that i mean i've been always true to that from the time i was eighteen and realize i wanted to be married and have a family and kids and all that i think that ultimately that that's where my true fulfillment comes from. thank you. bye. that's cool that's cool. okie dokie.,0,0,1,0.7545909,0.24540907,,,,,449
6,35,okay. and please. are you okay with. des. come. pretty good kind of. los angeles. the thing i like about ale the weather. what are some things you don't really. it's not easy to meet people. can you tell me about. well it just feels like people aren't out very much they're like that movie in crash where people are just in their cars all the time it feels like that. no. not too much. child development. well i have a son and i wanted to know how to be a good mom and so i wanted to know about the stages that he would be going through and be able to relate better to him. are you happy. i am. kind of i'm trying to get it started again in the fall. i love my job you could almost say it's virtually made for me. i like the right. tell me about that. i've written some children's books and i've just been doing research looking and so getting my books published it's only like two that i've written so far but they're pretty good i got some good feedback on them for my critique groups. it's about. a little boy that surrounded by people that are jerks and he tries to not become a jerk with him and if it's a bit like a really. he goes through a lot of moods dealing with the people in his life. you find it easy to be a parent. i know i have had some issues with nervous breakdowns actually and right now my son is staying with his dad so i know i was single mom it was the hardest thing i think in the world. so. how do i cope. all right now. i didn't have very many coping skills are mechanisms so. that was the problem. it's so spontaneous. make the stuff that comes out of kids mouth sometimes and the stuff that they do and just brings a smile to your face. well when i said was younger. once we were just sitting around the house and he comes and he starts doing my hair and he says to me mom i want you to put on some lipstick and high heels and ponytails so you can go out and get married and find a boyfriend. so. yeah pretty spontaneous things like that happen that my kids telling me i need to not be single anymore. okay. the hardest thing. not wanting to screw it up. have a lot of stress and pressure. that. every little thing is going to be in make a difference in matter. and what kind of person like it turns out to be. and. so. it's a lot of stress on yourself. yeah. yeah definitely. i think. i'm different from my mom. because i'm a little bit more tolerant of that spontaneous interaction i welcome it you know i welcome. getting to know who my child is right now and. not try to mold them into somebody that i want them to be but just see them become the best child that they can be the best adult that they can be without molding them in that direction necessarily into a different person. say it again. who someone that's a positive influence. i don't really have anybody. like that. what i'm feeling. i turn on the fish tank screensaver. hey i know it's not a lie but it's the best i've got. what do you do to relax. well. i've tried to meditate sometimes but i don't really stick with it often enough. i've tried to like go for walks but i don't always do that and i will always stick with it. so. that's about it. i say. i'm a little below average meaning that i get angry more than most people do i think. when was the. last night it was on the telephone i was arguing with my husband we have my sister lives with us and she lives with us in a very small room with a small apartment i should say and she's got four people living in one room so. it's kind of stressful it's really crowded and my husband is stressed out about it and you know i'm just saying to him that i told you so i told you if my sister moved in here. they said there was going to be a mess in the house and she's going to be asking for things you don't really want to do that's just how my sister is so the house is messy and it's crowded and everyday they're asking for brides and my husband he's avoiding coming home because all these people are home and he doesn't want to be there anymore and i just saying that he's going to have to find a way to deal with it because. he asked for it in my opinion. where does. oh i got time to bumble right now. but now my mind is losing custody of my son right now like i've been arguing with my stepmom and my step-sister for a long time about my son and how they treat him and how i want them to be treated like they don't have any boundaries. and i believe that boundaries are important in establishing who's the adult who's the child they let my child boss them around and stuff anyways because of this they're going to be testifying against me in the custody trial saying that. yeah there any saying that i'm not a good mom because i believe in having boundaries and we had very different ideas about child-raising she's my stepmom she's my dad's death wife. and she's. she really does it she's really far removed from how i was raised and i want to raise my child more similar to how i was raised where you we had some independent that we had some boundaries that we knew what the rules were and what was expected of us. where's my stepmom she invents no rules she has no expectation she just wants him to run wild and have everything that he wants and that's fine with your grandparents but the problem is that i live with him sometimes and when i'm in the same house with them they should be following my rules and not. trying to go and break all of my rules. anyway. yam. in that moment. just really frustrated because they don't listen to me. i fell. disrespected i feel like invisible i feel. just angry. that they're taking away my right to pair it and it's something that i worked really hard to do i went to school and i study child development i read all the magazines and i read the books and i really. i know what i'm talkin about i feel confident and my parenting skills in my parenting abilities and they have these people that have it done the same thing i worked as hard as i have to be a good parent try and tell me that i'm a bad parent. it's really. hard to believe so i feel very disrespected and acknowledge angry frustrated. all those things. i take i take benadryl to help me sleep. and i'm so. my doctor gave me that give you benadryl told me i can take it to help me sleep. last night i was crying. before i went to sleep. so what time do you start start running through your head at night when you're in bed. but i tried to push them out and then i got up and i took my benadryl so i can go to sleep more easily. i need triggered by something. yeah i'm always thinking about my son. i wish you was with me. and how unfair everything is it's happening. i like i don't deserve. do you have my son taken from me because i'm a really good mom you know. and i'm too hard on myself so. but i am a good mom and i feel confident that i'm a good mom or jess. i don't really have the money to take care of my son like my dad to send dad does he has more money than me. and right now i'm trying to be okay with it because. i know he can do more for him. financially than i could. that doesn't mean i'm not a good mom. i'm pretty depressed i'm on antidepressants. take wellbutrin i've been on it for a couple weeks now. i think they're working i don't know i'm not as. down as i was i mean i got here today i got dressed and i'm here today so.... my husband complains a lot he says. i'm not the same person. that i was when he married me. he said it was fun and i was positive and. i was all these other optimistic things that's another thing is on the phone telling you last night and. and. i'm not those things anymore which is true i mean we got married a year ago. and that my son was taken shortly after and it was just such. a shock. and. i've just been trying to get back from it. but it's been hard. did i think i had a problem before i found out. found out what. oh. yeah i like crying a lot sometimes i cry all the time. play. my family would invite me to family events. and i would go and just just cry because my son wasn't there. toram. i don't know. it's just all the crying i think and like i said my husband letting me know that i'm not the same person. so. he's disappointed that i feel bad even that i'm not the same person that he knew i feel bad about that to another thing i'm feeling bad about you know. you still go to therapy now. yes i do i try. i feel like the therapist useful. yeah it's nice to talk about your problems i go in there and i cry every week so i need to have a set time every week where i can go in and cry. that's i mean it's a release to be able to cry sometimes i feel better afterwards. yeah. and she helps me make decisions you know. help me to be more proactive in my life. well i'm looking for. jobs and things like that and she gives me ideas of why don't you work here why don't you work there have you thought about this or that you know and then she said something about how did you go back to school at so i went and applied to go back to school you know i'm not doing much with my life and sitting around all day isn't helping my depression any either. so i'm trying to find a work and i applied for college. in the fall i got accepted to dominguez hills. so i may be going back to school in the fall right now i'm still looking for work but she helps me with that kind of stuff just giving me ideas. that life isn't over there still more you know i could be doing this like like yeah. everything's always bittersweet. i don't know. last time it was really happy. i don't know. my ideal weekend. oh. i don't have a lot of money cuz i'm not working right now so really my weekends are just fed. reading maybe that i can't believe i can't pay much attention when i'm reading have a short attention span i can only read a couple of chapters. but lately i say that's what i've been doing is reading. something i read. okay. i need to go to usc they have these nights were. they have things like book signings or poetry and art is called visions & voices so i like to go out to their events. and i usually enjoy those. about two weeks ago deborah harkness was there doing a book signing for a discovery of witches. so like i said i'm trying to be a writer so i try to go especially to the book signings. and see what it's like to be an officer who's talking to a crowd and signing books. what are you most proud of in your life.

7,38,"looks like we may have. okay. i will step out when she says goodbye. answer. fun fun thank you. i'm from los angeles. well you can't beat the weather and i just think the familiarity of home just makes me feel comfortable here. smog rudeness although it doesn't compare to new york it's. people could be unbearable in their rude. not as much as i'd like a lately i travel more in the past but not lately no. i just think between different places and some. learning new things funny things that are fascinating that piqued my interest. i think spoken to your cuz i think the first time i went to new york i was quite amazed i know it says still only in america but i just think i'm being from la i didn't think anything or a city could be bigger and more how do you say ostentatious the new york but it was it was quite an experience and i didn't think any place was i. i didn't i didn't think any place was dirtier than downtown la i think times i think times square's got us beat. too many to mention i i don't even know where to start. depends on the situation. i like to walk i like to i like to play with my dogs reading anything where i guess i suppose i could just sit still and let my mind go blank i know reading requires some concentration but i noticed things that i don't have to exert myself too much help him relax. in the past i've had problems but i'm getting better. i probably are good my roommate. couple days ago but that happens we're friends loving argument if you will. i'm at this roommate about six seven years ago we just kind of got moved around the same social circles and just got a loan. it's cool i mean it's the he no like we do argue we have our differences sometimes but there's not one person i'd rather have i rather live with then then her she's she's cool. how much time do we have. is just too numerous to mention. my i would know how to answer that. i think breaking up with a girlfriend that i truly cared about but knowing. going bad just wasn't going to work. that was very difficult. just weigh pros and cons and just thought i just wasn't going to work no matter how much love or care i brought you a relationship there was something missing and i think that's enough time she invest enough timing. just knew it was over. no. so many i don't have too many regrets by things erased from your memory. a lot too numerous to mention i don't know how to answer that. the same girl that i broke up with shoes she was a girlfriend best friend of mine are they were separated for 4. several years and we always had a chemistry always a friendship and it turned into something to something which you don't turn into a relationship and it hurt him currently we do not speak i wish i might regret is i wish i i would have handled that better. it's it's funny soon as i as i get older i'm not as close but i still care for him and i still love them and i think they love me i my mother and my father both alive don't interact a lot very close to my older sister. my older sister. she's just strong no-nonsense she's short yet a firecracker and i've always liked that about hershey. joey's help make me feel makes me feel comfortable i'm like a another son to her in a way. supposed to depends on my stress level would have a lot on my mind. i have difficulty sleeping and other times it just i really need to get to sleep it just requires me listen to the radio they're watching tv reading and eventually i'll get tired fall asleep. crabby bill's like anybody else. tired listless you know all the normal things i supposed to happen when somebody doesn't sleep well. i feel good. no not really. well, i wouldn't say i have. no i have not. yes i have. i was diagnosed probably about. but five years ago. i think i always knew there was a problem i always knew there was some i think i always knew before i got treatment that there was some issue emotionally and other things that are very hard to explain i just was tired of feeling that way so i thought i'd help. i think just the letter g no desire to do anything motivation just wasn't there any normal person buy things up. so should i become socially awkward which was a little bit different for me because growing up i was quite talkative. i do. i'm sorry figure. got you a it does i think it does. well. i think the number one thing on this is what i'm amazed about the temper i think i've it's allowed me to. two step back from certain situations not take them so seriously and not get so tense or angry and then react they could just calm down for the most part. now it's becoming it's becoming routine initially it was very difficult. well 5 years old. i don't know which one of your kid there is nothing really to. got to be sad about your kid. my best friend. but you were gone i would have a dry sense of humor so you know my best friend would probably. i think the the banner back and forth is you know usually an insult but you know fall in love. i wish i could be taller i wish i could be more inclined to play basketball so i can become go to nba and be a millionaire i know that's all i'm realistic but honestly. i think i regret emily asked asked this before

deteriorating slowly he's only 30 years old and i'm. he inspires me because he's got such courage everyday he's always in a good mood even though he's suffering from life suffering you would never know so he inspires me so a time song. i tend to feel like i'm. i want to give him something back. he gives me so much everyday so sometimes i'll go out and i'll buy us a couple steaks or am i know he loves cheesecake it's all gone game cheesecake because at 30 years old to be suffering from the disease face suffering from where his brain is deteriorating slowly so he's losing all muscle control is starting to lose his eyesight this is like a slow killer which will progress and speed i guess as time goes on but he doesn't last long down and he's always good people now.. that inspires me to be a better person so i have nothing but respect and love for him so in turn. i try to do whatever i can for him. sometimes when our vets are trying to push him around us or white stand up for him cuz i

target are good stories. going in the mountains and seeing waterfalls then no one else is saying except for my people and i was the most beautiful thing i think i found. it depends on the situation if i'm if somebody comes to me looking for me to help them i take control it if i need help with its i work at asking for help so it depends on the situation. i garden. and i think. very good.. 3 days ago it was about communication and the lack of communication on the other person's part and i needed them to communicate better so that way i could understand and they didn't communicate so we had an argument and i got to settle. i felt i'm caught off guard because this is an individual that i spend pretty much almost every minute of my day with and to not be told what was going on in this person's head and then to have a situation arise and i was kept out i didn't like that. i got a pass. probably lack of time spent with my grandparents. just wanted on you regret that you didn't miss time with spend time with me. i want thing i truly wish i could remember i was i was a professional athlete and what time i have party till like 4 in the morning and then i had did my event at like 10

are. consistency even when you're sick. i don't assume my kids are right around by listen to him first and then make my decisions after that and i try not to come from an emotional hiding place but i think logically and i put myself in their place before i do it we discuss we communicate happy in my family cuz that's the only way we get along with each other through communication. communicate. my family is severed pretty much so my family my relationship with my family on the reservation is very tight and the rest of the family were all fragmented scattered around the southwest so it's not very tight at all. i have too many to count. start with my uncle my uncle was like my dad. me to go away. he watched out for me he told me he taught me hard work at a very young age he also taught me to protect my family. tommy honor. me love. it's a good man. how easy is it for you to get a good night. i don't lie ever had a good night sleep in years so i have to get broken sleep. are dreams the dreams you come through real. get up and go to the bathroom and go back to sleep. my years of fighting and just got up to me. reserved. reserved and i try to find things to distract my brain to think of different ways of doing things. i got rid of tv about 8 months ago so i got rid of that distraction so what i do now is ready to paint a garden or cleaning house washing dishes or get out the walk that's nothing to do a lot of walking out is. anxiety anxious. my anxieties. habits good i have techniques to bring myself down. nothing new. out of the normal. yes. 3 years ago around 3. insomnia issues. it was about. 2 years ago around there to look it over two years ago i was released from therapy. off the therapist release me. what i noticed is i still deal with pictures and emotions. what would i do is now if i really practice hard at taking care of myself and then getting to those places to things that. strike me give me anxious or excited or angry i learn how to work out of it and realize it's not real it's not real. that's just the emotion it's not real so these are the things like no manches and i tell myself and this is really helped me a lot from therapy because it taught me that those emotions and pictures truly aren't real. and that's the therapies helped a lot that mean it's just a change my world. if. around the same time as the ptsd. after years ago. in my dreams when i dream i do. last night. i just dreaming of fighting and then in preparing fighters to fight i wasn't nothing to i build up anxiety dreaming about preparing fighters to fight and then stepping in front of thousands of people and then i always end up fighting in my dreams so it's always what gets me scared in all my dreams is that i should have made the move and finish the fight and i didn't. and so builds anxiety and stressing me that i tend to act out in my sleep. i was real like i was there right like i smell taste feel everything their house there. on this morning driving here talking to my girlfriend. trustworthy. he loves me i love him he's more best friends. a 02 change. i can recall. okay. i got it. just not spending time with my grandparents and in. i think they today issues maybe you know a couple here there that i should have went to the store first or something like that but i mean it's nothing like that. quit thinking you know it all. my loyalty. my trustworthiness. the new art project yesterday. nice. where is santa barbara from the film some rocks and some old rock song someone that made by loving just threw a dump old rocks out of the way and it went through the pile of rocks and i found the soul rock that was in the middle of it and then took a home and now i'm doing art piece on it and for me it was like the thing was totally forgotten about was just considered a rock and now they're sure you'll be sitting in my grand kids table and let's just give me a call like that. what are you most proud of in your life. start starting something that i'm so bad at. then i don't think there's no way i can be good at it and all sudden i get to be better at it so i don't even have to think about it just so good at it that way i could just touch it and feel it and then i think about it these are the things i'm proud of like i like that i like that. accomplishment i guess you can say. her her left clavicle needs adjustment. her clavicle set tired makes it look like she's been in a car accident and she's like this sheet her left shoulder is up higher and it's question so you're off and it's drawing my attention to that so i don't know if you guys noticed that to the other part of it too is the hand motions that she does some of the hand motions are very aggressive in it and wakes it was very distracting in the beginning because she was like. fast moving like my therapist cuz we working with the ptsd issues he that he did everything slowly cuz i said off on quick trigger movements and so like with her hand movements like that. like this talkin it was distracting in the beginning but besides that everything is just like it's pretty amazing computer but it's and you feel comfortable that is a good thing. yeah

11,57,okay thank you. yes. i'm wonderful how are you. california. yes. the weather is one of them i have the food and the way i everything is centrally located. the traffic the smog. and. it's just gotten really really overcrowded. i'm sure you can tell by my shoes. i wouldn't say a lot but i do try to travel at least once once or twice every two years. just exploring different things and being able to have different experiences things of that nature and no learning new things and i'm just different cultures that i like to learn about different cultures and when you travel you get a sense of you no feedback from different cultures and different areas so i like that. well i just came from miami i last year i went to miami for a week and a half it was really nice the weather was great it was my first time going and it was wonderful the people are really nice and it was really a great experience i went out there for a particular event they have something every year i'm where everyone comes out from all over and they just kind of party and hang out and meet new people was really fun. well from that trip i would say. swimming and the beautiful beautiful beautiful miami beach waters was wonderful. yeah it was. child development. well. i've always been interested in children since i was younger my baby's had a lot so i had a lot of experience with kids at a young age and as i grew older i realize that it was something that i like to do so that's when i am looking to child development courses and i thought that it was something like that i wouldn't enjoy doing so i started taking classes and the rest of history. i have gas it's been 15 years in august. yeah. my dream job. i would say. to become a principal. what is something that i thought about doing for a while now and i've actually just began the steps to try to get that going so very back in school and i'm going to be taking courses i'm so that i can make that happen because it is a dream of mine thank you. it's going to be pretty difficult there is several years of schooling that i have ahead of me and you know it's definitely going to be a challenge but it's something that i'm up for because it is a dream job of mine so it's something that i'm willing to i'm willing to do. a little bit of both i think a little bit of both i can be shy at times. in and out going as well but i think a little bit of both i would say. what do you do. i meditate i i'm a big big meditator so i love meditating i love just reading and just having nice quiet peaceful time. oh wow i'm very very good at that very good at controlling my temper i again series of meditations that i do it involves deep breathing and just really censoring yourself to where you can feel your heartbeat and you can really feel everything in your body and it really really allows you to de-stress and to control anxiety and anger and things of that nature yeah that helps me a lot. oh wow it was just recently actually unfortunately it was last week and it was with my husband and. it was about. just the way he responds sometimes to me i can be a little aggressive and we're just trying to work with that because i don't respond well to aggression i totally tune out and that's actually would happen so yeah that was it. i felt very frustrated. and i actually felt angered to but more frustrated and i felt fat and too because i don't like arguing so it was a little bit of all those emotions that one time. the situation watch i wish i would have handled differently. honestly i haven't had a situation like that and 20 years i've pretty much kind of. you know kind of mastered more responses to certain. stimuli i kind of got that down. tell me about. the hardest decision i've ever had to make while it was when i was 16 years old and i became a teenage mother i was pregnant at 16 and i had a lot of pressure from family to give my child up for adoption or to abort and i chose life so that was that was one of the hardest decisions is not the hardest decisions to make as a 16 year old teenage teenager just whether i wanted to continue to be a kid and a teenager or whether i wanted to embark on raising a life when i was just a child myself so that i think was the hardest decision. i had to make. well i mean my son is almost 19 now so it's 19 years later and i actually am so glad it was one of the best things that i ever did by not choosing to avoid him and chew being pro-life pro-choice pro-life and. and i have not regretted the decision that's my only child and i love him he is just a blessing he's just a blessing and i feel very special to be his mom. i do oh yeah. i know it's it's not easy it definitely has its difficulties i'm just as anything but at the end of the day it is really rewarding and you just get to see the life that you brought into the world and that you've raised become productive citizen and go out in society and start making their way and it's really rewarding it really is. oh wow so many ways. the first what are the first way is i actually listen to my son and i are accepted feedback even if i don't like it and i allow him to express his self fortunately unfortunately when i was little there was not a lot of conversation from parent to child it was more like we were just told you know what to do and we did it and with my son i give him options allow him to express itself allow him to give me feedback or negative or positive because i feel that it's really important for a child to develop their voice at a young age and that's parents you have to be supportive and that and kind of make sure that you nurture that because that's kind of. the way that they develop me now and it's really really important so i'm different and i and a lot of ways and that right. thank you. well. it depends sometimes it's it really depends it depends on the time that i go to sleep it depends on the time that i woke up so it's a lot of factors i can't just give you one answer i would say that. it varies sometimes i can go to sleep and fall asleep right away and other times i can go to sleep and it might take a while to actually fall asleep so it varies. i've been feeling great lately i've i really have been. i can't say that work for the last week didn't affect me you know the argument with my husband but other than that i have been feeling really good. no i haven't. no i have not. you know what honestly i feel happy everyday you know everyday i wake up i'm happy because that is a chance for me to. take advantage carpe diem seize the day so i feel blessed every morning i wake up it's a blessing you know because i realize that some people did not wake up some people are homeless some people are going through so many situations that are really disheartening and that's not me so i feel really really blessed everyday. thank you. as nurturing patient loving friendly. kind of reserved. well i wish that i had already completed college and had my master's degree and sometimes i wish i was a little bit more knowledgeable and certain subjects. and i can change that if i could change anything i would change that those two things and also i would be a little bit more outgoing and less of an introvert. you know what no regrets no regrets you live and learn nothing is perfect everything that i've gone through has made me the person that i am today so i wouldn't change anything because i'm happy with the person that i am today. oh man to stay in school to stay in school and to get your education and put that first and foremost before relationship even before your career i really really would have told myself to stay focused and to get a great education. i'm most proud of. where i come from. as a teenage mother being a statistic and actually changing that being on my same i've had my same job for 15 years now i'm really proud of that i've been married for 13 years i'm really proud of that happily married to my best friend of my soulmate

different.",0,0,1,0.7450567,0.25494328,,,,,660
13,71,okay thank you. and please. are you okay. yes. okay other than this laryngitis i have. a cleveland ohio. in 79 i think it was. once a year or something like that or less. there's a lot more to do here. they're a little more narrow-minded back there and republican. well originally show business. but probably to get away from cleveland. it was very difficult at first. i'm not used to change i don't like change very much you know having to. meet new people and figure out how to make a living. well. i like the different opportunities you have the different the health consciousness the movies. the variety of things you can do the places you can go the weather. the driving the congestion some of the superficial attitude. the importance. well not a lot but i do i just came back from vegas to visit relatives we met there and i'm going to mexico next month. well seeing the different cultures like i've been to europe greece france italy i like going to places such as mexico or it's going to be sunny and just lying out i went to last year i went to arizona and ever saw sedona that was really. an experience peaceful. about sedona. yep well sedona is a very energetic place and i thought it was desert like flat kind of desert looking but it was very rocky and when you land in flagstaff there's these beautiful pine trees and the elevation is high and then coming into the doughnut was very beautiful and and after a day the pain in my back went away that i had there for months so anyhow this even though we went to bed late and got up early you had the energy so is really very mystical. in life. or incident in life. well being on stage in boston. and that was great i love doing that. just being with friends and laughing some of my highest moments when we were laughing hysterically. well. i don't know if a particular situation but when i when i decorate for special events and i worked with somebody on a regular basis and we would just find humor in everything and just laughing. and i can't think of particular situation or what we were laughing at but just being with somebody who's in tune with my sense of humor and gets my jokes and you know i get his and we're just enjoying that moment. speech and drama. i am a traitor. oh no not now. i always was interested in. musical comedy when i was a child i would sing along to records in my living room. and i was always inquires in school and then when i. went to highschool i join the drama club. and i just always had an interest and i always had a big personality and. well. i don't know if i have a dream job anymore i'm 60 and. i don't know if i have aspirations anymore to towards doing anything right now i just rather not work in chest. relax and travel but. i like being creative and in any way i can i like independence and i kind of have that right now so. i'm okay. i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got. well i i watched my favorite television shows that i've recorded. and i also am a buddhist i've been a buddhist for. gosh since 1988. and i'm at district leader in my community and we have meetings and that really helps to center me and bring out my higher self so if i get tense or nervous i i chant. sometimes okay sometimes not. a lot yes yes less and less though it's been happening less and less. but. yeah sometimes it's got its hit some created difficulties. well. i can't remember an argument i remember getting angry like was just when i was on my trip in vegas i was driving and the gps said stay in the left lane and i stayed in the left lane but when i get off the freeway it brought me onto the ramp that went back onto the freeway about 4 miles out of our way and i just. i got very angry for about 30 seconds and then i had to call myself down and say okay alright so we're going to be late and i had to talk myself out of it so it wasn't really an argument with anybody but i felt kind of bad that i overreacted. you mean in my life many's yes. ashley so many. i just wish that when somebody tells me disappointing information like they're not going to use me on a job or something that i would. take an attitude that. i'll find something better it's okay and move on as opposed to feeling what's wrong with me and you know did i do something wrong and then get angry at the hammond. you know that. whole thought process that really doesn't help the situation. can i do that more often but i since i started chanting but it doesn't you know i'm not always in my highlights get to where i can do that. i find a lot of situations to talk to me like you know what television to buy yours but. i guess the hardest decision would be one that had the biggest consequences and. or leaving my comfort place if the decision meant that i had to leave my comfort place that would be a very difficult decision for me. and probably leaving a relationship. very hard because. it your i get dependent on that relationship so i usually live it out until. that's for it. it's believed or something and it's very hard for me to make that decision that this isn't right and i have to move on so what i usually do is i don't make the decision and i end up suffering with longer. cell. can we move on. how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep. well it's hard because i don't know if it's because i have pain in my back. and neck but it's difficult for me to stay asleep i i don't get it a deep sleep. but. because of it so it's hard to say because right now i have this cold and i've had it for 2 weeks so i've been taking nyquil and that's been putting me to sleep so i have been sleeping better because of it but last night i had woke up coughing so it's it's hard to tell but before that all happened. i was. finding it difficult to stay asleep. and so therefore i'm tired during the day and. sometimes i'm groggy sometimes i'm irritable. but i'm not really sure if it's related to this pain in my back or emotional things are or are not. i'm sorry could you repeat that. have i studied changes in my behavior. no. i was not. no. oh why i was like happy last week you know. can you tell me about the. well i. was going to vegas to meet my family with my my family is flying in from cleveland to there we have a relative in vegas and i drove with my friend. and it was my brother-in-law 70th birthday so we all went and had a good time in vegas and i was struggling through my cold but but it was fun it was nice. well. are they think i'm funny they feel that i say it like it is. then they all say they understand me so people who don't understand me i think sometimes don't know how to take me cuz i'll i'll say something sometimes it come up come across sarcastic but that's just the way i talk. so. my the anger that sometimes wells up in me you know i just but although that that really made me i think a lot of the person that i am you know all the all of your. experiences make you who you are and how you handle them. makes you who you are and if you don't have those lowe's you don't really know what hyzaar. so i don't i can't really go back and regret and i wish certain things didn't happen whatever but really what matters is today and now and how you handled today and i wish that well i can't i don't wish i know that i will have less of these moments where i just burned out you know anger or something i just wish that would happen more or less that anger parts what happened less and they are so. i guess it will. having less. don't give up hope live in the moment. and. everything will everything will work out everything will work out. and if you believe that then you really have nothing to fear. the fact that now and for the past 20 years 20 some years i've been cultivating myself and i've been i've become a more. compassionate person. and i'm able to. understand people better and see that you know they're they're suffering too and that if you if you treat people from that respect if they're they have their problems too and they're suffering with their problems to you able to live a better life because you're not allowing that to affect you if you're not taking it personally and at the same time you're becoming more compassionate person and when you're more compassionate you're you're happy and your life is happy. okay.,0,0,1,0.7118393,0.28816062,,,,,451

different countries meeting new people all about and the language. am i lived in greece for over a year i taught english there and i moved around to different parts of greece and really had a great time. i think just having my group of friends that i met there and going through the experience with them i think one of my most memorable experiences was going to elephant ethos in a car with everybody and having a just a fantastic time. yes it was. i think i'm shy to begin with and and as i get to know people that i'm much more outgoing. photography in language studies. i turn on. it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got.. how much is a stay-at-home maybe watch a movie. rest in bed watching a movie in bed that's probably one of the things i like to do to relax. i think very good. it was probably with my boyfriend. regarding money issues. i need to i feel guilty about not generating as much income as i need to right now. i'm having some struggles in my career right now and financially it's becoming very difficult. i'm sorry. sounds really hard had two husbands been difficult but i've been working very hard to to remedy that. great. so well i'm here and then i'm doing this this focus study i'm doing him any things to generate more money working harder but looking for other ways to generate money outside of my my career. probably being raped. have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd. no. you have concerning thoughts. sometimes. are they triggered by something. not that i'm aware of. how you been feeling lately. i've been feeling stressed. i've been feeling. been feeling stressed and worried. how easy is it. i don't seem to have any problem with it might seem to get a good night sleep almost every night. i'm grumpy and and lethargic and in the morning. situation i wish i would have handled differently. i really can't think of one right now. the hardest decision i've ever had to make. was probably deciding to not have the child. can you tell me if. well i was pregnant and. wasn't sure whether or not i should continue the pregnancy and that was also due to financial burden and the father of all was involved with did not want the child so i made that very very difficult decision. tell me about the last time you felt really happy. really really happy. i know when i went to cancun on a holiday over the new year new year. near holiday. i felt absolutely fantastic i felt happy i felt relaxed i felt like i didn't have a care in the world to temporarily free. what are some things you wish you could change about you. i wish i could be a little bit stronger and more assertive. definitely more assertive. i would say i'm a wonderful wonderful friend when i left somebody you know i love them very deeply friends family. boyfriend so i think that's good i'm very loyal as a friend i'm honest i care about people i'm fun to be with so i think those are some of my best qualities. my relationship with my family with my father is not so great my parents were divorced when i was young and he's sort of been in and out of my life you know forever mostly out so that it's not fantastic but but it's something that i'm used to so it's not as painful as it would be a patty been there and then i lost him but it's it's still it's still it's still not the best situation i mean i still wish that could be remedied some. there's good and bad relationships in my family. who's some of the positive influence in your life. someone that's been there for me since i was very very young and is always been just incredible when i love her so much. what advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago. 10 or 20 years ago i would have told myself to work harder than and not have so much fun so i don't have to work so hard now. a guy regret exactly that i regret i'm not taking my career seriously earlier on because now it's been it's been much harder. tell me about something you did read. i think it was taking the kids to the pier and spending some wonderful time with them and making them happy that was probably a great time i'm one of the best times in the last few weeks. and and they're they're great kids. you find it easy to be a parent. no i think they're there it's challenging it is more difficult because their stepchildren so there are some times when i'm not sure exactly how much to get involved and how much not to get involved but we're very lucky because they are really good kids they do tend to fight a lot but. but i but it's not as difficult as i think some other parents have it. what are some ways that your. and your pet. i made it make a make a conscious effort not to not to punish them or over punish them i make a conscious decision not to scream at them the way that i was scream. i was screaming a lot as a child and it was really it was really difficult so i make sure not to do that. what are you most proud of in your life. i think i'm most proud of the fact that i have been able to travel the world. and live in other places many many other places around the country and around the world and the fact that i learned several languages. and that's what i've been able to maintain really long long long relationships with my friends. thanks for sharing your thoughts with me thank you. goodbye. post survey for you to fill out.,0,0,1,0.70365745,0.29634252,,,,,395

stuck out here then i have my baby and i just ate. different food the people get along way i don't get it it's kind of a culture shock. tell me about. out there just on the food bases they like to give you a lot of food that tastes real good for a little bit of money to keep a lifelong customer but out here they want to go up there and give you a little bit of food for a whole lot of money so they just make it mike. parent have business out here. not our got to get used to anymore. the views in the ocean. just splitting of people that's it. just a few places. what do you enjoy. getting in to see different people on learn how different people get along and interact with each other. i want to hear about your trip. i remember years ago where i went to mexico with my brother. yeah. jumping into a lake pretty much off the side of a mountain. yeah. everything. it's not a subject i don't like. actually my dream job. working with computers and helping people. that's. where my heart is i like computers and also like helping people. sometimes when i'm feeling 10 i turn on the fish tank screensaver. i meditate workout. i'll run i walk. alright read. in the median. i'd say very good. oh yeah that doesn't make it seem that good last time i argued was over someone actually spitting out a racial slur or it's my wife. angry. upset her disrespected. and especially when i went up there that treat the person actually i was treating them with dignity and respect and trying to help the person the first. no problem people are people. how to chance in school with a really go a lot further than i did. and i let something very small and meaningless stopped me in the pursuit of it. ignorance. for lack of a better word. now that i think back on it i could have done a whole lot to avoid it but i was just young and foolish. start loving again. much pain as i've seen in the world. tell me about. a compilation of all the events are just different bad things that i've seen. if i could change it i would but sometimes. i guess things are there for a reason even though we may not understand it. i have no answer to that. blood family really don't talk. my wife. don't know if she really wants to be there with me or not she thinks that i'm doing everything in the world but that i'm not really. i don't understand i know my daughter loves me but i don't know if she wants to be with me or not. because. when somebody talks to you. when i say something a certain amount of times in the tonnage in a voice and a belief in their eyes. if you say something so many times it would really lies in your heart so you can say whatever through your mouth but it's what really is there. i love my daughter. she's angel i'll cut her umbilical cord went out there and put on her first shirt. i seen her come out. she looked at me right out the stomach she wouldn't she was fighting with the doctors wouldn't let him touch her a bit. i talked to her i told her to calm down i told her it was daddy she looked up at me grab my fingers and like just calm down and just let him do everything they needed to do. no it's constantly changing fast what you have to do on this day won't be the same thing as the next or the next after that it's constantly. what is a better word for. adjusting. the hardest thing i'll probably say. is. spalding your child because you know you're doing it out of love for not learning the wrong lessons. seeing your baby smile and appreciation. i try to guard my baby a lot more from things that she sees. when i was younger there were a lot of things i seen that no child or adult should have seen and. i grew up. i swore to myself that always take care of my child and i wouldn't disappear. let her be around things like that. okay. my foster parents. can you tell me about. they basically showed me no matter where you come from. you can always strive to get better. okay. how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep. a good night sleep. it comes. the same just tired of yarn. have i been feeling. ike. i have a wealth of queries and. a well that goal. within my grasp and it's just right out of my route because i just need that one. connector to

are polar opposite in many many ways but there's things about both of them that i love. i have to pursue acting and writing. it's still not complete reality to me but it was actually very easy because of the the the the creative factor out here allowed me to pursue what i wanted to creatively and there's different the social culture was different in a way we're at from where i had grown up and it it suited me better my personality. i like the fact that you can come here and pursue any any niche of in creativity or art or entertainment that you want to and sort of make your own path i grew up where its nose constantly and is very very cold so sounds obvious but clearly i like that it's you can swim year-round and i like that it's there's always something to do no matter what day of the week it is. i don't like well i miss my sam i miss that there's no i don't like that there's not a big family element here i miss i'm a big family girl i miss my family i feel like it's very crowded here but yet it's very easy to feel sort of isolated alone here. i'm sure you can. i can't see you she is but i do mostly just not up to much worldly travel mostly back to boston and florida where my parents live but i do enjoy traveling and take a lot of trips within california and around here. i just have an adventure do something fun or if i'm going home it means i want to see my family. oh my god well i like to drive up to northern california go to san francisco and family and friends they're always super super fun. in college i with my college boyfriend from boston to eat we drove we went to san francisco and drove down to la and las vegas and that was kind of how i realize i wanted to move here so that was very that was ready i was a big one. in general. i guess it would be moving here i move to when i move to la i got on a plane with didn't know anybody here and i just got i talk to a girl and i met online and agreed to be her roommate and she pick me up at the airport we never met and you know one of my dear friends to this day so definitely don't deflate out here was his big monumental. i felt powerful and excited and just open to whatever. telecommunications got a lots of every lot of different writing writing styles eventually graduated with a concentration in public relations and english minor. what made you decide to do. writing cursive writing. writer of i guess you could say writer-actress which is but i guess writing is first. hard very hard because you need to know he's going to push you to do what you have to be self starter you have to make it happen so it's very hard cuz i don't think that's that naturally in my personality i do but not as much as i need to. i would say are going on in general. pink screensaver. i sometimes take a walk if i feel tense listen ambient music helps if i need a soothing background white noise calming, area and just it's your basic depressed and just sort of take a minute to come back to it, mitchell place. i am getting better at controlling my temper cuz i don't usually have a temper too often but when i do and i lose my cool i have a hard time controlling it. yes. no. argue with someone god. i guess it was a friend a friend a girlfriend if it wasn't it was about our. are each separate perspectives on a a certain situation between us but obviously very very different and it started out as something big and then we just realized this is this is stupid we don't need to be fighting about this so it kind of ended quickly. i guess it would have been with an ex-boyfriend fighting with an ex-boyfriend relationship stuff definitely losing my temper and making a situation escalated in a way that it didn't need to be i wish that i had just walked away from it. i don't know if i could have avoided the complete situation but i definitely could have. may the outcome much less. chaotic. i guess that would be. walking away from somebody who was definitely bad toxic from my life, but i really did want in my life and it was a true wrestling with morality and. kind of sort of growing out my coming to a point where i have to say i'm going to do something that's really really hard for sort of me no short-term pain for long-term gain and i had to make sort of an adult decision relationship-wise but it was still carry over into other areas of my life and taught me that you know you're not always going to feel great every decision is not going to be easy and feel good. are you happy. yes. i was kind of forced to this issue was just what was going on in life was sort of can ignore those signs just yeah. i guess it would be a particular argument i had with somebody that happened to be in sorry about public place and got in trouble for it i wish i could erase. mileage to my family have a wonderful family completely blessed amazing parents have a brother and as he has a little girls have a baby niece that i love more than anything in the world and i could not ask for a better family therapy the idea. my parents for sure there's wonderful people and then stop by example and i feel like i'm a good mix of both of them. how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep. pretty easy i try lately it's been a little bit hard my sleeps been off but for the most part i've come to recognize the importance of it and it's it's been pretty easy. lig fidgety maybe a little bit out of it i might might seem like i'm in a good mood cuz i might be a little gideon laughing more just sort of high emotions but overall get irritated faster and just sweat more just feel feel just a little off. not really just try to be more focused get things done. i'm just trying to focus on what i want to do career-wise and really. stop wasting time or if you know just procrastinating and get things done and being inspired going and seeing you and being around people that are doing what i want to do and just carrying it over to my own life. no. no. oh just a couple days i was just in with my family and my baby niece in florida and that's why i went down there to see her so it was just awesome i'm always happy when i see her. probably as very. funny humor would definitely probably one of the first things they would say joking always a little wiseass and my personality but they would describe me as always at unconditional there for them and just. they know they know that i'm there if they need them always. my drive be more driven and getting things done. i guess it would be bought a recent a recent ex boyfriend that was a mistake of a relationship. yeah sort of just. the they think because he the way he felt about himself certain things he would say and even though what he said didn't directly make me feel about the whole situation made me realize the fact that i'm even with this person made me feel like i'm allowing people into my life that shouldn't be there so i'm dumbing myself down and that was terrible. yes i regret not listening to my gut instincts. don't second-guess yourself. great listener. constant sense of humor very malleable in terms of people tolerant and comfortable around all. people from just all ages race gender whatever i just i crave diversity and love to just meet him i just i'm a people person and i start everyday with a blank slate. i did some acting work on a on a series with a really great group of people and it was it was a very cool cool creative experience by inspiring. probably coming out to la on my own without knowing anybody and staying here and pursuing what i want to do. thank you.

17,88,"there we go. bring up virtual human. chat with her for a bit and i'm going to give you the. yeah. i'm doing good. arizona. because of acting and other stuff like that entered the entertainment industry. no. not at the moment at least. currently a student. i produce hip-hop why rap and produce hiphop i play video games and then hang out with people. no. not very good at break things. on the way over here my mom and how to get here. the beach. imputed. i know the last place i went with los cabos. when i go somewhere mexico. no. no. yes. i like 4 years ago. right now na. lately not very easy. not just lately. call my wife left like three weeks ago and after that i haven't been able to sleep. and i just bury my head and stuff i don't know how to do stuff i try to keep my mind off of it like do yoga and other things keep my mind off of everything. i don't have to i never went to therapy. when i did go to therapy. like 3-4 years ago. cuz i went to a separate therapist but then i went to i think we're at they did a bunch of cognitive test in memory test and then she diagnosed me with a type of depression that lasts for a long time like i get depressed and it lasts for months on end. yeah. to be honest i don't know i think it's more about like you focusing on yourself and like i don't know i don't know how to explain that it's like you have to figure out things within yourself you don't need someone else to talk to. well raised me when i went to the therapist i was court-ordered and i want to go to therapy for my anger management though. i don't know.. i mean my wife left like 3 weeks ago so yes. it's probably the hardest thing i've ever done so yeah. well considering i'm only 19 if i could go back 19 years i would say not to fuck up and let myself get depressed about certain things that would have drove away my wife and not to be angry. yeah driving away my wife. gas mini many things every day every day. i could have not broken stuff. and i could have a. stop the legos basically blocking out the external universe and i was putting everything into myself and like focusing on other things so that i don't focus on the real life i was basically escaping until tonight since i wasn't paying attention to her and that's basically why she left that mean that i'm being angry is like both contributed their own portion. earlier today. i mean i feel really happy all the time and then it just goes away it's like back and forth like one day on one side and i'll be really happy and then another second i'll be really sad cuz i'll think about some onion and i got to keep my mind off of things and like move forward and like thinking. i really know how to explain it it's just something you feel. know any better programming. silly. i'm creative potential of intelligence. charming and loving. at some point, all those things at some point.. doing yoga playing video games and having my wife around. my hip hop. i mean kid traveling. you need better programming kit traveling is my friend. to be a hip hop artist. i don't know what to start on monday. not hard anymore let me know so i was practicing when i was younger and i was like 11 and 12 no it's easy. i'm still in school. no problem. yeah i have a nice day bye bye. did i started clicking it twice and i'm like.",1,0,1,0.7273418,0.2726582,,,,,309
18,90,"hi. i'm cool. fine. new york. i was 6 months. 6 months ago. nice of pace. photography job. are you happy. she's a good movie. i love you weather. cool people. relax you just talk to you. nice environment. crime when you go through some sections. done my share. the ability to. capture events. be a part of it be apart of exciting things like. olympics games festivals. special shows. meet new people. which one. canada. it was nice. a very refreshing clean environment. all the people seem to be very light-hearted but you able to do serious work. i love the landscape. i think was riding on board an amtrak train. liberated. photography. hi i think i'm doing that job. i really believe i'm doing it not very difficult you know not at least not for me because i think up some natural inclination for it. i know i connect with people. i must try but i'm forced to be outgoing because i and i can't really get anything done being shy but given a choice i'd rather be you know. a little more full back until i do not talk i feel like just the closest a safe part to go. so that kind of cuddles with my spirit of adventure sometimes i think. example. well an example of what exactly do you mean what aspect. okay well example like traveling sometimes you want to go to a particular place. and it's a. something great happening there is no such a great place but it's not such a cool place to go like take them some like boston i used to go to a lot now you know everybody i talk to you a little bit nervous whether they should go there you know to do you know i have a great time we think is that a good getaway spot still right now sound like a fan. how many i. i take walks. i called the friends we have to something. i think i'm pretty much got that under control. it's probably something silly in a work situation that last about five minutes and pretty much having fun again i don't really dwell on. negative things too much. i don't have any regrets right now. i really can't think of anything right off the top. brown decision i've ever had to make was off. not hiring a good friend. for a job that you know they weren't qualified for. that's hot. i am because you have to explain to them that it's not to friendship you're hiring is still competent. my father. i just saw. taught me how to. you know what, difficulties when i was growing up and how important it was to not give up. and be able to see the right side of any situation you faced because it goes away in a few hole in there long enough and i are found out to be true so. it's okay except for somebody off. distance siblings you know i don't see you as often as i can. i was just you know when you've been your travel quite a bit you just don't see people go spending it always there you know there's nothing like yeah. well you know i'm i get pretty excited if i'm working on something on developing something so i tend to overlook the time sometime but other than that you know when i write them out, that's it. well. i guess i'll be a little bit off. i'm trying to figure out how i'm going to get sleep you know as soon as i can. thank you for the try not to be grumpy or anytime just probably filled up at night. i feel okay now. changes like what. well i actually am i hopeful future icu. i see a lot of new things unfolding i mean from that perspective yes. nope. never. i feel okay now. i went to great parties last week. that was really cool. well it was like on a rooftop and a lot to really are nice people who are basically in the same kind of a mindset are pursuing the same type of goals. i know it was all quite inspiring actually i got a lot of information i know a lot of good connections were made. awesome guy awesome absolutely awesome. party weekend. is a. cooking my own food relaxing. you know i know if i'm in the mood for company yeah i have friends in. family members join me. well. i kind of like to put on more weight sometime but that doesn't seem to work. are you like crazy and nothing happened. well you know i charging people in general sometime. miss mystery do you know if you kind of like her. if you look different now you're in a different type of a different set of things make you excited or you're into a different way of thinking people tend to misjudge you you know and that used to make make me really be upset sometime but yeah i'm kind of figured it out and i'm pretty much over that you know so i see it as their loss not mine you know if they didn't get to know me you know that's hey maybe they don't need to and it doesn't really bother me i'm kind of work those things out in time you know. yeah. are my best qualities pocoyo. listening i think. honda. maybe just talkin you know how the conversational level. sometimes people tend to burden me with everything they got because of that but you know. i guess it is that's probably why it seems i come to the tough so when i when i see too much of that i just saw pull back. go for your dream. believe me what you're doing. don't let anyone discourage you and you'll be okay and that's the way i feel now that it's kind of evolved itself. postpartum. i think my alarm. my my my kind of spiritual relationship you know i might mike my settlements about. not being too too anxious about. but things are going around me and being able to see that you know there are no mistakes that really happen. and you shouldn't really eat never lies have to be defeated i'm proud to be able to have arrived at that point in my. my my thinking my friend work. i think i'd save me a lot of problems that could have been differently. anger questions. bye-bye.",0,0,1,0.746058,0.253942,,,,,432
19,91,okay. i'm pleased. are you okay with this yes. pretty good. i grew up in boston. about 30 years ago. yep. i'm too often maybe once a year sometimes less. oh i love living in that way i don't ever want to live anywhere else. well i came out here to go to college and i wanted to be far away from my parents and the weather was good and. that's part of it. a very easy well maybe somebody's at the beginning the first few weeks for it's really hard to just be in a new environment and to be away from everybody i knew but after a few weeks it was great. broadcast journalism. well it's something i'd wanted to do since i was 12 and everything i did from the time i was twelve until i went to college with sort of in pursuit of that dream. are you still working in that nope. well it's kind of a long story but i got laid off from my first job when i was in my 20s and it just once i'd done that work i realized that's not really what i wanted to do is to cut throat of a business and it just really wasn't suited for me didn't make me happy. yep. dream job my dream job is working with football players and helping them recover from concussions and other injuries. well the work itself is not very hard i'm very good at what i do. the hard part is finding the right people and making the connections to work with them. i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i have not much of a world explorer you travel a lot i used to i don't travel so much right now. what do you enjoy about. i love seeing different places and different things like i love going to places that are not like. where i'm from. i love to hear about one of your trips my favorite trip is i went to australia from my 30th birthday. cuz i wanted to lose my 30th birthday as i cross the international date line. and i went to this really small place up on the west coast of australia called sharks bay where native dolphins live and swim and is very isolated for the most part and i got to be there for a whole weekend just really just pretty much by myself with all these wild dolphins and they come in they swim with you and it's amazing just a beautiful beautiful spot in the world. more shy. why that's a good question partly the first thing i think of is cuz i've always been that way but maybe that's an excuse i don't know. i just prefer to be quiet and i'd rather be with fewer people than lots of people. so. i watch tv about this probably not the best alternative but it is something i do and i also walk on the beach cuz i live close to the beach so that's one of my favorite things to relax. pretty good. it depends on the situation but most of the time i'm pretty good. i don't think i tend to argue with people i think i just get mad about situations but not at people directly. turn up i feel guilty about anything at the moment. that you wish you would handle differ. not sure i have one at the moment. noise other people's noise makes me really mad i live across the street from a bar and these people are so rude and obnoxious and not consider it their neighbors that that just makes me really mad. yeah. well i'm only want the comes to mind off the top of my head is is when i bought my condo it feel like a really hard decision at the time you know i didn't know that i could do it i didn't wasn't sure if i had the money to do it. so thoughtful like a really difficult decision but in hindsight course it turned out to be a great decision but at the time it was really difficult to do that. how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep pretty easy i sleep pretty well. for the most part good i'm i'm just really worried about money at the moment so that's my biggest so i can't say that i'm like great but it's cuz i'm worried but you know i'm also confident that things are going to work up. have you ever been diagnosed with p. nope. i don't know i can't remember. i mean i don't feel super happy all the time but i don't feel unhappy either sort of like just a even keel. really enjoy. well i got to go to the my friends work at the motion picture academy so i get to see all the enough oscar nominated movies. she was there one night so i really enjoyed catching up with her and seeing her again so that was very pleasant. nice. how your best friend describe you. i think they would say reliable and. well. and considerate and thoughtful. no i really worked hard on that i think there's lots of things maybe i would do differently but there's nothing that really i regret. well i just think that there are things that. like it's not worth wasting the energy to think about things that i regret so i don't have a lot of regrets about things. that's a good question don't worry about the small stuff. and save more money. well as soon as you know the normal things like i'd lose more weight than i would. think be a little more fearless maybe. be a little more bold. i don't think i have any of those. it's been your ideal weekend. well i'm i'm self-employed so i work all the time so my ideal weekend is having lots of clients that's something i enjoyed. so that would that would be ideal if this point my weekends if i were really busy. how to make your life. that i've really been able to take care of myself and that you know i've done pretty much everything that i've said that i wanted to do. i've done that and i don't mean i don't have regrets about things there's nothing really that is unfilled undone in my life sure there's plenty of things i still want to do but i feel like i've done what i said i was going to do. yeah that's not so great so it's okay with my parents are deceased and i have a sister and a brother. i feel closer to my brother than my sister but they both live in the east coast and i live in la and then my sister has two girls so i feel very close to my nieces although we don't talk as much as we used to cook their teenager so. i have other things on their mind. probably my teacher person i've learned my holistic bodywork from i really like to model my work in my way of being after him the keys are a good role model for me the way he holds his work in the way he lives his life. i'm pretty close we're not you know that's her friends but i do i know that i can call him anytime i need him. what are some things that usually put you in a good mood. you're being with my friends are going out to dinner or. yeah just spending time with my friends. okay. thanks. it works again.,0,0,1,0.7179758,0.28202423,,,,,378
20,97,"might have pulled something that. i'm going to bring the great thanks so much. and please. are you okay with this yes. oh i'm fine i'm a little tired but i found out my thyroid is i think acting up so. where are you from originally i was born in canada. but i've lived in california most of my life so and it's gray today too so the gray weather makes you kind of see no sluggish. oh my gosh years and years ago. not at all i don't think i can text to her for a long time well the air fares have gone up quite a bit in the last few years gas prices have gone up so travel as much as it's a fun thing to do it's cost-prohibitive so. oh that's see everything has plus and minuses cold-weather not as much sun so i think i'd prefer getting more sun and having the warm-weather so but other than that it's it's very pretty back their natural scenery in but i like it here you know the traffic is kind of heavy but that's a small thing to deal with. why did i move to la because my family came here and started to my dad got a job here and thus became our home base and. that's why. easy very easy sew. well in high school you generally study general ed they have designated courses and then after that went to college and i was a business major let's say i was a veterinary major and i graduated with a degree in liberal arts so. i don't know can't really pinpoint. i was working in social services but i've also worked in sales and most recently i'm doing real estate, leasing consultant part-time. i mean everything has plus and minuses it's it's okay it's not i don't really see too many negatives. oh probably to work as a gossip columnist it tmz or one of those networks but as you know everything in the entertainment business is very competitive it's who you know so but that would be my dream job or probably working with cats you know animals. so. i'm very outgoing in fact i think i'm so echoing i scare people sometimes there's a lot of quiet you know reserve people out there so i'm kind of east coast very you know i go up to people and talk to them first social. sometimes when i'm feeling 10 i turn on the fish tank screensaver. oh my gosh there's i could do hundreds of things i could read i could watch a show turn on the music music is great take a walk call my friends. million things so. i'm pretty good i'm very good i mean you know of course when you're driving in la and somebody cuts in front of you sometimes i can be irritating but i'm i'm actually pretty i'm not the type of person that will fighter jet i don't like to have confrontations so. i can't really remember so that's why i said there's not very many arguments usually i avoid arguments at any cost so. do you feel guilty about. i don't really feel guilty about anything right now or that i can think of. i can't think of anything right now. i really can't think of any decisions that were really hard i mean most of it's pretty easy for make me to make a decision so i don't have a family so if i have to you know i had to moves to san francisco for a job once but since i'm single it's i don't really have to consider other people and children and that type of thing so kind of makes certain things easier when you don't have other family to consider. yeah. in advance. well obviously you don't you know the passing of a family member you know you wish everybody could be around forever so i know when my father died you know i mean i wish i would have had him for a lot longer and he died at the age of 77 and you know what have been nice to have him around a little bit more. but you know i can't control those things life has its own way of dealing with that. yes there are yin and yang that's ancient philosophy and it really applies here is pluses and minuses the negatives and positives so. well like i said my dad's no longer here and my mother and i you know we have our differences i think mothers and daughters always do my brother and i get along great i see him a lot my sister works a lot i see her and you know we talked and she's kind of got her own life and her children i get along great with them so. we have a small family. once again it's like that's a hard question to answer there's so many types of kids up there i think majority of them seem to be pretty well-behaved i mean you know there's always going to be children that are cut out of control but i don't know the ones that i've seen recently the very well behaved so can't say much else about that. well i live in an apartment and i don't know if you've ever lived in apartment but there's someone that lives above me i'm on the first floor and there's somebody on the second floor and they're pretty quiet but they have a habit of i guess they have lots of energy they usually will take their showers around midnight and sometimes i'll start washing laundry at midnight and of course the pipes run through the bedroom wall so it sounds like niagara falls and they are and so i don't ya and i need 8 hours of sleep and i've only been getting oh i'd say like maybe 6 hours and then i usually wake up once at night take a sometimes they'll kind of around 2 or 3 in the morning go either walk around or i'll hear something so i'm not getting a straight 8 hours of sleep and it's definitely but there's not like i said there's things you can't control when you live in an apartment you know i means that the ladies look very quiet it. just that she has a habit of you know taking later showers question close at night that's i can't say anything to her about that. yeah but you know there's people that are in worse situations so i don't make a lot out of it you know and i just it's not like every night but it's you know at least twice a week so you know i have to consider sleeping in another room but for now you know that's i'll deal with it so. tired very tired and hard to focus hard to concentrate it just takes me longer to get things done cuz i don't have my energy also i haven't been exercising i normally try to walk about half an hour a day but the weather's been kind of colder and kind of dreary or so you know i'm not as motivated when the weather is kind of blah so it's a combination of both not getting my exercise not getting 8 hours sleep. how you been feeling lately. as i said before tire has a combination of the weather you know i'm here in los angeles right now we have been having very gray days i live very close to the ocean so the sun doesn't come out that much so i'm not getting my serotonin i need that i am i getting my 8 hours of sleep because you know whatever and i think my thyroid is acting up too so that's kind of creating you know i have some vitamin deficiencies and you know once the sun comes out i'm kind of more energetic it just gives you that more energy. have you ever been diagnosed with p. no. no. i hope i'm happy most of the time i'm a pretty happy person and i like to be around other people i mean of course i like my private time but i do like being around people quite a bit so. can't think of anything right now i mean i usually enjoy everything i do there's nothing that stands out more than anything else. okay. is there anything you regret know i never regret anything. what advice would i have given well i guess yeah i could probably change things around i think it everybody could i probably would have had a different college major in a seems like. what else i probably wouldn't have dated certain waste of time with certain people. i don't know those are them things that come to mind. maybe started saving money earlier you know those types of things. but. how your best friend in spanish. outgoing lots of fun to be with just a good friend to have people like having me for a friend i'm loyal trusting and. i listen i'm a good listener i'm very patient as well so. what are some things you wish you could change about yourself. well i never wanted me to lose weight but i think that's a worldwide problem i mean there's a lot of food around and temptations and especially here in america a lot of us are couch potatoes we sit in front of our computers we. you know it's just easy to real it's so easy to relax you know it's hard to get up and move around you have to talk yourself into it so that's the way that you know house gives you more energy to if you lose weight so that's a big thing as well but that's probably the thing just the weight thing you. i understand. how do your best friend describe you i think you might have asked me that question before her. but if you want i'll repeat it so. i'm very like i said i'm very loyal when i tell people i'm going to do something i do it very reliable i am warm i'm very friendly great listener and i mean i've heard so many people tell me they just like being with me so like i said i'm very i'm pretty upbeat you know i'm don't let things get me down too much so. how have in your life. that's a hard question that can't think i mean i'm. can't think of the answer that way so. 4fun well i love movies so i could see every movie that they make i love going out with my friends shopping swap meets my gosh and traveling is great road trips. that's kind of. we know part of it yeah that i mentioned so. traveling getting to see different places the history aspect of it the foods and joined foods in different countries the architecture it's just kind of need to get away and see a completely different place. okay well i've been to a lot of places in europe i love paris is such a walking city you can whoever designed that city i'll tell you i mean it's you can get from one point to another the subways are great. each area has its own distinctive kind of there's the latin quarter where the students are there is another area where let's say the fashion designers are kind of like our rodeo drive here in beverly hills there's an area that is more african and they have swap meets in the weekends that are wonderful is for international. and then like i said when she get out of paris there's just so much history you can go see versailles there's other palaces you can go to the south of france you know. but that's probably my favorite country i've been to italy as well so. yeah well after college people usually many people that go to college or either before or after college that's a great time to go to europe because you're young and you're not tied down you don't have a family and you kind of have a more adventuresome spirit you got more energy so carrying you know backpack or suitcases it's not not a big deal so yeah that's. thank you goodbye. oh that was that was fast. but i didn't never said there wasn't any like shocking question. never know i guess.",1,0,1,0.7336102,0.2663898,,,,,386

the lights down low and listen to soft music. i'm getting better over the years i think i'm. pretty decent now compared to how i used to be. got you in trouble yes ma'am. due to the lack of i guess you can say controlling my emotions i have been incarcerated at the prison. okay. i'm not sure i don't really have a recollection of my hardest decision i ever made in my life. probably few days ago with the girl i was talking to and i was arguing about her lack of communication and attentiveness. yeah. i frustrated. because. you know how you be put in a certain amount of effort and you expect. you know the same effort by the other person when you're in a relationship in the same time when you when you have expectations sometimes you can set yourself up for failure or so. you know i guess i'm just learning. a lot of situations over hank differently. probably the most recent was a. i got into a physical altercation with an inmate when i was incarcerated and that made me that's what sent me to prison in and i had to do a lot more time. and if i handled it differently. probably wouldn't ever want the president and i probably would have been home a lot sooner than originally happened yet. tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory are several events i wish i could erase my memory. probably. my first girlfriend. she did something really extreme it wasn't necessary my eyes and it and it could have cost me my life i think that that that's a recurring thought that i wish i could completely erase memory along with the good memories as well. a few youtube fights shootouts getting job getting robbed. you know those things i think those inhibit me. i guess to explore certain areas of life that i'm not comfortable with south of the few things that he'll be nice so i can erase it completely. yeah. hurting people i didn't need to be hurt emotionally especially. few women in my life are my past. probably put my mother through certain things that shouldn't have to go through along with my close friends and family as well. tell me about your relationship with your family. used to be rocky growing up but as i got older mature and discerning spirits that i've been through kind of brought me closer to my family so now it's it is pretty decent this is pretty soon. i would say my mother. yeah mother. oh she she she had her share experiences negative and positive i might her the struggle she been through. she she she has experienced difficult economic hardship growing up but that didn't stop her for raising a son at a young age finishing school getting her masters in just just overall being a good person and she also about her mental health issues as well and probably not the best of family that she could have been raised with social so she's kind of like a inspiration to to me and other people as well so i was your mother. how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep. it's not easy so yeah it's not easy. i can tell you i've always had sleeping issues why you should just take like over counter sleep medication or nyquil but it makes you drowsy the next morning so it looks like it's a negative effect really. the medicate i don't know shitt i don't know but i just stop taking it cuz i don't like to feeling drowsy. not good at all. can you tell me about that. yeah i mean i recently got released from prison not too long ago. older now and a lot more responsibilities and i feel like my life is not worth supposed to be i feel like i could have made a lot more better decisions in my life you know sometimes feeling sorry for myself and things that i've been through and the whole nine yards so. there. i'm sorry. saul good. cicero. yes. two-and-a-half 3 years ago. myself i am i was i was just tired of. not i don't know i guess school kind of made me sick help because i started to understand myself by my brain works you know so i decided to seek help maybe. to better my life. yes i am. yes. yes i do actually i do. better decision-making better tools to reflect on choices how to control. certain situations better yeah. well instead of just always reacting on emotion no matter what kind of motion it is i stepped back in and then assess the situation and i'll to see what's what's the best way to to react towards situation and by doing that it has made me more mature emotionally mature and just has positive outcome. tell me about the last time you felt. i was laying next to a beautiful woman who cared about me and the feeling was mutual so that was probably the most happy. oh my goodness. spontaneous. outgoing. sometimes a little crazy. fun. that's about it. nothing. like i said earlier just you know hurting. the few women that were my life my past and. my friends are family that's about it. oh shit. school is really important. how i carry myself to people who are surround myself with and what i choose to do my free time so there's a few things i would tell myself. good music. good thing basketball. sex. i like going out i like going to parties social gatherings where everyone's friendly and has no drama that's what i like. dancing beautiful woman. couple drinks is about it. what are you most proud of in your life. i guess not necessarily giving up and in. just just. i don't know. just keep going just now giving out really. computer finish up with a post survey about your experience.,1,0,1,0.7644706,0.23552945,,,,,426
22,113,okay great so everything's all set up now okay. okay. sorry about that.. want to give me one second i'll be right back okay. that's okay. user. we have this. yeah course. so that's all right so just keep going so i'm going to. something for our purposes after i start. kind of spooky. okay. hi i'm ali. created to talk to people in the states. and please. are you okay with this yes. good how are you. i am from los angeles. yes. it's the center of everything that you can get to all the places you need to go to without having to drive very far i like being in the city. well meaning la also you're dealing with traffic a lot of congestion and obviously the environment as far as the air quality is not that great but you know you live with that. why was a business administration major so i studied business and after i finish college i am pursued a career in retail operations. are you still doing that i know as a matter of fact i am not a kind of changed career over the last four or five years so i'm concentrating more on the human resources side of the business. a couple of factors after working a new mercy years in the retail business i switched over and worked in a creative business which is a graphic design firm and i captured her now a lot of knowledge in the in the human resources side because i was the operations manager / benefits manager for a small company. are you happy. yes i'm very happy i did that i picked up a lot of knowledge and and is very helpful. i love my job you could almost say it's virtually made for me. well my dream job is. i'm basically kind of doing what i want to do now because i am a independent contractor i do freelance work as an hr consultant using all the knowledge that i gained from previous jobs and i utilize that with the flexibility to do the things i want to do as far as personally and have the time i needed to do the things i want and obviously i worked hard early part of my career so the financial aspect of my retirement is already set in place so i do what i need to do as far as maintaining a certain lifestyle but also i have i also enjoy what i do i'm not under as much stress as i used to be. i'm not well i'm not totally outgoing but i'm not i'm not extremely shy i'm probably right in the middle may be more towards outgoing but i'm not totally out going i mean when i'm around other people i am in a social situation that i guess you could consider me right now going person but obviously i do have my own little private issues that i keep to myself. can you tell me about. oh sure you know i have. couple years ago i had a heart attack and i had had bypass operation and it had it had to do with stress and things like that i don't talk about that much other than those around me that are close to me if i meet someone new i don't just openly say well you know i've experienced this this and this so i just basically if it comes up i won't deny it or if it comes up and it's a if it i feel like it's something to talk about i will talk about it. sometimes when i'm feeling 10. hey i know it's not hawaii. actually my relaxation is i'm currently living with my mom my mother and she's a senior citizen and she's alone so what i do for relaxation or to relieve stress is actually help her do yard work take care of all the gardening and things like that and that's actually very therapeutic. i'm not thumb. shortfuse kind of person it takes a lot to get me really angry so as far as my temper is concerned there's not there's not much to that. i'm trying to think here i can't recall when the last time it was but it was probably last year sometime when i had a creditor that i was dealing with being very difficult to work with and i owed money as far as some medical expenses that were incurred when i had my heart attack a few years ago and they weren't very understanding of the situation and i i i really got a little upset about that because i felt like i was being honest with them and i was i was more than willing to take care of my issues but they were playing hardball and i didn't care for that. it does. probably the hardest decision i ever had to make was. it had to do with a life-and-death situation with my my stepfather who is battling prostate cancer and making a decision with my mother whether to proceed with a procedure that was going to either help him or there's a slight chance of going to help him even though he's pretty terminal at that point or it would it would kill him you know and that was really tough it was really tough decision to make but you know i felt like if i didn't try and see if we could save his will help save his life or if it we didn't take a chance and then take that extra step that i would regret it in the long run. it is i was. well right now i'm separated from my wife so she has her issues i have my issues but we are not divorced we are just separated and we still have a relationship where we still speak to each other we just don't live together. and the relationship with my mother is really great you know she's very understanding i'm an only child so she likes having me around which is good because she's in her late and she's in a later stage of her life she's 82 years old and and so she needs to i guess it's good that end in its own way maybe fate is taking place because you know someone 82 years old by themselves in a huge house is not a good thing but with me there i think she should do the comfort level she feels with me there especially being her only child. something you feel guilty about. probably the most guilty i feel about anything you are the things that i did to hurt my marriage as far as. the things that i did the selfishness that i did when i was much younger that obviously affected the relationship between myself and my wife. yeah i am. got caught up in a situation where i was working tremendous amounts of hours under a lot of stress my wife was also working a lot of hours in a job that she had and that we were growing apart and when she was away my form of release was to go to the casinos and gamble and so you know i spent a lot of time in the casinos and what eventually happened was i spend a lot of money and always see that was a major issue regarding our relationship had to do a trust because i'm. and it was devastating to my wife. i felt what weight when it came to light i felt very guilty and i felt less than a human being at that point in my life. no not at all. diagnosed with depression no not really no. how easy is it for. i don't have problems sleeping that's why i don't ever recall having any problems sleeping so no. no not at all. no i will i just don't think i could say is. after i had my heart attack a few years ago i don't let i find myself not letting the small details or small things in life bother me as much as they did before so i tend to be a little bit more easygoing and my friends and family have noticed that. tell me about the last time you saw. the last time i felt really happy. probably when i had a visit with my cardiologist after my heart attack and he basically said to me that after many tasks and many months of rehabilitation that he was happy to explain to me that there was no scar tissue no major scar tissue that had occurred with my heart because of my heart heart attack and that i could count on living a pretty much normal life as long as i watch my diet and took my medications. what are some things you wish you could change about. well i guess number one thing is. my physical being itself i like to be a little bit more healthy or lose some more weight just in general just be more healthier physically and as far as mentally just not go back to the old ways of thinking where i was doing the wrong things instead of the right things and not to be so selfish. just one day at a time you know i just try to be at peace with myself and try to have some peace of mind on a daily basis i meditate i read you know i read some books i watch tv i do things that i know that if i can i get if i can help myself i do things to help myself. there's a lot that i regret obviously in my marriage my working career as far as i had a long career with this majors food chain in and i basically because of my gambling issues i ended up ruining a very good career but. at this point right now there's not much i can do i can't change what's been done so i don't focus too much on the past i just look at what's in front of me and just focus on what's in front of me everyday. what advice wake up and and see what you're doing to yourself and you know make the changes you need to be changed you know you know i'm not a. i'm not someone that's not intelligent but i was intelligent enough to know what's right from wrong and. yet what you doing is wrong you need to change your behavior immediately. probably. the proud what i'm proud about overalls the fact that i did all these awful things but deep down i don't think as a person i'm a bad person i have to remember that when i was caught up in all the gambling in compulsive behavior it was because i had an illness of compulsive obsessive compulsive behavior that made me ill and that i was a sick person just trying to become healthy and every day that's what my life is about it's about recovery and just making sure that i do the right things from the time i wake up in the morning to the time i go to sleep at night. one day at a time. it's not as hard as you think it's but it is a process where you need to be diligent about your behavior and your routines and just know that what's not right for you and i could be okay for other people to do certain things but i cannot do those things anymore. how do your best friend describe. what's my best friends can describe me as probably easygoing generous a nice person to be around and. you know. they were obviously a little shocked when they found out of all my issues related to the gambling and the and the breakup breakup of my marriage which you know it's still not over yet you know. well my ideal weekend starts off usually after i have breakfast with my mother early in the morning like around 6 i go to a local park and it's about this park is probably lay down where you can walk up a hill and down a hill it's about three and a half miles and i take a brisk walk in the morning get my blood flowing and get my heart rate going and then after that i am. can i go home work in the yard a few hours take a shower and relax and then just kind of kick back for the rest of the day and then the next day i i do the same thing again in the morning i have to go for a walk work out in the yard watch tv whatever just relax that's how we can goes for me. thank you. bye. lock yourself out. okay. kind of like i actually got comfortable talking to.,0,0,1,0.722444,0.277556,,,,,363
23,116,"looking at you all right okay so now let's make sure the xbox kinect is picking you up with his move around dance. can't wait till this guy pops up is like a little green skeleton. okay when is the temperature let you know and you can just hit the door. so let me know.. thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment think of me as a friend i don't judge i can i'm a computer i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get it started and please feel. your answers. where are you from originally. moscow. vitamins for life my family move to the us and then i moved down here eventually for college. how easy was it for you to get used to. long time to leave the money here for about a year since i graduated so there's been a lot of ups and downs but finally gotten adjusted to it so it took a while though that's good. how do you like your living situation. i have two roommates and there's a little bit of drama here and there between the girls but for the most part after a year in a couple months i think we finally learned how to live together but it was pretty much like a reality tv show for a while. how do you know the ones from college and the other one i found on craigslist. how close are you to that varies depending on whether or not we're mad at each other so i just pretty cuz. right now i kind of distant. tell me more about that event the distance. okay, well we haven't seen each other around hung out in like 2 weeks cuz one of them got into like with car accident and so she's been distant since 10 and kind of locks herself up in her room. and the other one is always working late so we are scheduling has been off and the ones we made an attempt to hang out with anyone so it's kind of we're just waiting for someone i guess to make the first move. yeah that sucks it's okay. how are you at controlling your temper. it depends with whom. i'm dealing with i guess i would say it was them people i guess is my family's not very good my boyfriend is not very good but with other people that i might not know so well then i'm able to control little bit more but i'll do a little more passive aggressive rather than my full on anger. sonic songs. houston has been a positive influence in your life. she's probably been she's been we've been best friends for high school freshman year of high school when we first mom. give me an example of that. as of what. how do you know that my friend to call we met in french class freshman year of high school we were in the same class and then we kind of surgeon homework together and we had a lot of cloud the same classes together and so you can send hangouts and then we just became closer and stay really close since then. what are some things you like to do for fun at going out with friends and the bar is going dancing biking hiking staying active then the movies playing at cedar restaurant stop tography. was hanging out with friends i guess whatever okay. how close are you to your family and various like i'm really close to them when it comes to things of a like schoolwork those kinds of things but when it comes to relationships and friendships and more personal personal things i don't really discuss that with them. vegas superficially club. but i rely on them a lot so what by guess. what are some things that make you really mad. i guess it depends who it is again i guess people who are in considerate and thoughtful flaky ignorant and. yeah and get those kinds of people and then people just and it's a lot of things that people react to different situations can make me angry i guess. when was the last time you argue with someone and what was it about my boyfriend and we argued because he's trying to be healthy and workout and save money and so so finding that when he doesn't see the orders pizza in so he's not saving money and he's not very healthy and so i got frustrated with him cuz i'm constantly trying to push him to be healthy and that each time he was going to do it when you do it then he doesn't phase consulate breaking promises that's another thing that makes me angry people who don't follow through. yeah. do you feel that way often. about other people about myself or angry. whatever comes to your mind. angry i am so glad that now i don't feel angry often. okay. what's your dream job. that is a tough one how about getting paid to leave me now that's kind of what i'm going to figure out right now cuz i quit my full-time job because i hated it as opposed to sitting in an office all day which i thought was extremely boring so now i work in a restaurant job and i'm too old for a second job to support myself my dream job. i don't know what it would be but i know it involves people and i'd love to have some kind of like finished product or some kind of accomplishment turns band and yet there's something i realized i like to see. the result from all my hard work cuz i majored in sociology and as much as i love that major it's you realize it's a whole lot of theorizing in arguing but with no real solution such as like as a and that's all you have is just being theoretical element that you can't do anything with and nothing to show for your work except for a piece of paper with your essays or no people amazing artistic i love photography i love cooking baking and particularly so i know something. and that. mom i guess okay. you travel a lot i used to travel a lot my family is known for traveling we've gone to 578 different countries i've lived in three or four different countries i haven't traveled a lot lately just because i have no money and jobs kind of tie you down but i would love to have that is my dream job would be a photographer for national geographic that would be awesome or a food photographer that traveled but anyways you enjoy about traveling. in the new places near faces and experiences i get restless very easily it says nice of conflict be on the move and see different things and see different cultures and types of people and just not get stuck in the same routine i hate the routine and monday mass of everyday life is so it's nice to. does things.. i want to hear about one of your trips. okay. tennis tank mermaid trips. i have begun talking about i don't know what's funny even though i've been to lots of different country is one of my most memorable memorable trips as one of the trips i took with my family is a three-week road trip with my family this five of us packed in a tiny little station wagon but it was really fun and even though i've traveled so many places i realize that there's like such a beauty and the american landscape and so we were all around this house last in the grand canyon to zion to the grand tetons to yellowstone and it's absolutely amazing to sing about natural beauty is so and it's a grizzly bear black bear the bison sounds really cool natural wonders also really miss me cuz those things aren't men made as as pretentious as it sounds after while you're kind of gets old but it's like and i guess the same way. white old white man building great buildings in artwork and yeah i see what you mean. how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep. i want. pretty easy as long as i. get supply i sleep so easy. what are you like when you don't sleep well grumpy and just very lethargic and just low energy don't say much i just kind of offer in my own world you feel that way often anymore i usually get enough sleep and i've been working out more so it's not too bad that's good. have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately. i haven't just been one negative but i have to do it by circumstances kind of like spend about almost 5 months since i quit my full-time job haven't found anything else boyfriend interested in so. esmeralda's like what am i doing that i did that kind of thing. can be talked about a good job these days it is higher than market and looks like i'm very picky because i don't want to just sit in a little my own cuba fault if i quit my job exactly for that reason why go back to another job just do the same exact thing that i quit my other job so it looks like i have to make it worthwhile that i quit my last job to get a better job as a kind of like stuck in this section of like living paycheck-to-paycheck barely making it just waiting for the right opportunity to come across but it's like when did i give up and sell my soul and go back to the corporate world and spitting and we'll keep a cold i don't know when does that same situation after college so but i guess it's tough cuz a lot of my friends so they went to a pretty good school and you not have a friend his teaching english in afghanistan. teach for america and their friends in hartford at schools like harvard matthew not getting her master's that's kind of like. got that comparison and then here i am with you in a little restaurant job so. do you feel down. i do sometimes yes but i'm going to hawaii next week so right now i'm fine yes but yeah usually it's been kind of like down because i'm just trying to find like what i'm supposed to do you not like what i want to do next and my money situations are just very stressful as a school loan to pay off insurance rent car loans like ants the groceries but i can't even afford groceries it's just hard to live this way specially after we paid so much money for amazing cause education so frustrating but there's a lot of people the same situation. turn down. have you been diagnosed with depression i don't think so but i mean i think everyone goes through depression here now so i don't know if you can but not like medically diagnose i'm not on meds okay have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd. okay. what advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago. oh that's to try lots of different things and not be afraid to fail cuz i'm one of those people from not going to be the best at something and i'm not going to try except the best or nothing at all go big or go home so but i didn't get them told my high school self that don't try lots of things even if it means i'm not going to be the best at it about 10 years ago made me like 12 so. i used to do a lot of things but i used to ask and it got to continue doing that i used to write a lot when i was younger i used to write miniature like little sorry sorry sorry it's for my parents all the time and i kind of stopped doing those things cuz it's like i'm not good at it so i'm not going to do it i just continue doing those things and tried sneaking out of classes and i'm no different sports soccer growing up i don't know just expand my sophomore rather than likely i'm good at and just stay with it but never really try harder cuz like i said i was going to say that one that was like once i'm good i just stay for good and i'll try that go about that that monster newsom. yeah. what do you do to relax. all right now it's super lame but i watch tv but i used to read of mice to read on my off-time or just listen to music or just take a nap or bake bananas like since i'm on my feet all day and like consol interacting with people i just kind of want to unwind by like sitting and lying on the couch and be like i'm done. which one of your most memorable experience. the top question. i'm probably the day i got accepted into pomona college it was a freshman at wellesley college courses that woman called back and i hated it from mike ii from like the first week i just knew that i chose the wrong college not like miserable for the entire year and i only apply to one school of the transfer pomona college by steps at in clermont and. anime how can i get in and i also because there's like a 4% acceptance rate and if i go to the chances like this is ridiculous i don't think we can get in and i'll let you know the thought of going back to sleep but then i got an email from one of the admissions counselors that i had met when i was visiting pomona and he's like i talk to you i just wanted to see if you had any last minute questions about pomona hope all is well and i was like why are you telling me the day we find out if we got you next that's it or not unless i got the acceptance and so sure enough a couple hours later i got the email that i was accepted into pomona and i was like my best day of my life so happy cuz i want ya and i text my mom and my little brother. hair pierce my dad's i was like let's start this whole thing over. how do your best friend describe you. the voice. fine. maybe moody you never know what you're going to get sometimes. probably. definitely friendly like a positive person. but sometimes maybe a little bit. aggressive. the most practicing positive things i mean she's my best friend so okay. when is the last time you felt really happy. really happy. oh and i was in mexico over winter in san clemente and that was really fun and it just like when sailing and walked on the missions at the beach that was really fun. don't forget time to greet the situation at school. okay i think i've asked everything i need to thanks for sharing your

it's really hard. i don't usually sleep well so yeah i have trouble falling asleep mostly. i guess it's just like my mind will be racing a lot of you know sometimes it'll be flashbacks of bad memories just you know thinking too much. i don't know i think just stress you know a lot of stress every day just everyday stress so yeah pretty much that's the trigger said. i just try to stay positive i try to think like okay well you know one day things will get better i just i try to call somebody and talk to them if i have trouble like my grandma. thanks. when i don't sleep well well i start to like crying a lot and i start to get really irritable i get really depressed it makes me not feel well at all i get very it just it's really really bad if i don't get sleep yeah yeah thanks. yes. is diagnosed 3 years ago. i just i didn't really know what was going on and i realized no cable they just diagnosed. and i was like okay well this is the problem and it i just wanted help because it just when your mind is after you like that's like it's just awful to have your mind taking control of you like that yeah. yeah it's hard. yeah yeah i definitely always thought i had a problem i was at something was like really wrong and i just always like kind of nervous around people like i never can really like to look anybody in the eye cuz i'm just so nervous my eyes are always kind of liked racing and i would have sweats if i was in the situation that reminded me of the situation like i just try to avoid what reminds me and bring those flashbacks yeah. oh oh i've been feeling good i've

glad to be part of this. i'm most proud of a well try thinking what i'm most proud of. i. i think i'm most proud of like the fact that i am able to you know not be like oh i mean most people i know they like deny that they have a problem and i'm proud that i can actually like you know be a person who can realize okay i have a problem and i need help but a lot of the people i know they don't take medication their untreated and they just don't want to get any help and i'm glad to get help because i don't want to feel that way and i want to get help for the problem instead of feel that. oh gosh

30,149,okay sounds good thanks. yes thanks. i am well thank you how are you. i grew up in oklahoma. i moved la about five and a half years ago so i used to be on the wet on the east coast and then i decided i wanted to come out here. my hometown not very often most of my families moved away so i visit them but i don't actually get back to oklahoma march. oklahoma's very different ellie is a lot more exciting there's a lot more to do here and the ocean obviously is very nice. you know that's a good question i i wanted to try something new and i've always loved the beach and i thought i also like big cities so i thought la might be a good place for me to come. very it's probably one of the best decisions i ever made. kizi i think it seems kind of natural that seems like a good fit i just really like it here. that's great i have a couple of roommates and we get along really well i live a couple of blocks from the beach and every day i get to walk on the beach or you know hang out with friends and it's just it's kind of like being on vacation all the time it's really nice. i studied philosophy and political theory in government and did a little bit of english literature on the side. it kind of just happened naturally i think i went to a liberal arts school and got kind of exposure to a lot of different areas and i just followed what i liked was interested in and ended up spending a lot of time studying that. not exactly i work for an educational non-profit so i work with grad with graduate students in the social sciences and humanities but i don't actually use my philosophy background very often. you know i haven't actually study to become a success coach and so i working with students has is kind of a nice aspect of of doing that but i'd really like to work with with other people so i'm not just students but help them to achieve their goals and realize their dreams. hey it it's fairly hard i'm in the sense that. you know it can be challenging for people to actually be motivated and do all the work that needs to be undertaken in order to realize their their dreams but it's also a challenge because making a living at it requires charging people money so i'm finding people who are willing to pay for that can be difficult to. i'm definitely on the shire side i'm an introvert so. i'm pretty good in one-on-one situations with people but when you get me in a group with more than a couple of people i very much an observer so i tend to listen a lot and i'm not as engaged and i think that is something that goes it is noticed by others and it maybe is a little bit odd to them especially if they're not introverted so i bet say and it's also challenge 10 not to be the person who introduces myself in a room full of strangers. pretty good i think but i do have a temper so i can get i can get upside from time to time. really it can be a challenge when i'm driving but other than that no. i'm not sure. it would have probably been a discussion over politics and it probably would have been a friendly argument probably with one of my liberal friends so but i actually can't remember the specific time. i meditate i do that almost every day i also walk at the beach i love the ocean and i really like the sounds and just being out there is very peaceful and i like to read and be alone just with my thoughts so that's nice. well let me think about that for a minute. having a hard time coming up with anything i mean i'm sure there are plenty of things just nothing comes to mind. okay i'm sorry. well this isn't exactly an event it's with the dream and it's not a particularly traumatic dreams as far as dreams go but i do have it sometimes probably more often than i like so i wouldn't be upset if it even if i didn't have it and it's just a version of a dream that i think a lot of people probably have but it's usually me in school somewhere at the end of the semester haven't gone to class taking the exams know i'm going to fail and you know really unhappy about it wishing why did my studying attend class the way i should have which actually wasn't really a problem for me in school but now i have the stream sometimes and it's kind of frustrating and i'm not exactly sure. why i mean i know why but i don't know what it applies to because it's not like i am worried consciously at least about failing things so. no i don't think so at least not not that i'm aware of. i feel guilty i have a brother and a sister in law and a nephew and they live on the east coast and i love my nephew he's 8 he's adorable and i when i used to live there when he was younger i spent a lot of time with them and since i've been in california and particularly in the last year i spent a lot less time visiting them so for example i saw them for week of christmas and then i went back and i think beginning of may so it was you know for months between the the last time i'd seen them and that i felt bad about because we really enjoy each other's company and he you know really likes me to be there but then he gets upset when i leave and he asked when am i coming back so that some. that makes me feel bad sometimes. well i have a brother i'm very close to him he's younger and. he's like for four and a half years younger he's married i have a nephew my both my parents have passed away so it's just the two of us and we have a large extended family but we're not that close with them with most of them on my father's side there's one brother and he's married and has if you could drive to cousins on that side then on my mother's side there are. 545 other kids most of them with several children of their own so i have a lot of cousins on that side but they live all over the country and so we stay in touch a little bit through facebook and they're a couple that i talk to you on the phone and visit every now and then but you know we're not that close with our extended family so. say it well. i have a lot of friends i think that have been positive influences. when i came out to california and i started working at a nonprofit and it was kind of a strange place is very different from what i was used to it was a little bit challenging and she also work there so we worked on a program together over the summer and got to know one another and we just established this really strong friendship and she's kind of i would say my best friend probably here and probably just in general and now she's moved to vegas which is a little bit tough for me but we're going to napa this weekend so that should be good but she's been a very she was a very positive influence because when i came out here to really know anybody in a know since i'm an introvert it's not that easy for me to make friends is really nice because we share a lot of same values and we have a lot of fun together and you know i think she kind of gets me so it's a lot of fun to hang out with her and and that's been nice. how is your day. i'm a sleeper so it's pretty easy sometimes my you know depending on how long i've been awake i can be without a little wound up and somehow got to take a little while to decompress but i usually meditate right before i go to bed and that's very helpful and i can sleep. i generally sleep in 90-minute cycles so usually six or seven and a half hours but i can easily sleep 9 hours if i have the time and inclination i usually don't wake up in the middle of the night or at least if i do i don't remember it so. well i actually don't sleep very well when i travels one of the things i do for work is i travel quite a bit because i work for a company that's back east so i work from home most of the time but then i travel like one week a month and when i travel i'll take the red-eye and then i'll visit with a lot of friends in the evening so i don't sleep that much it's not that i sleep poorly or badly it's just that i don't have that much time to sleep and the first day after not sleeping or not sleeping much is okay usually the second day it's not very good sounds like a lot more tired and it's harder to concentrate and i don't know it just feels like more of a struggle. good summerisle is an is a busy time for the organization that i work for so i'm a little i don't know stressed is the right word but you know a little anxious about everything going well this summer but in general i'm feeling pretty good. really i can't i can't do anything there is one thing i am i do struggle with exercise like i like to walk a lot and i hike with friends and i have been really motivated about it for a couple of months but then i went away to the east coast when i came back i was a lot less motivated cuz i didn't really exercise when i was there and i gotten out of the habit even though it only been about ten days and so now i'm struggling to try and get back in the routine and it's not going as well as i would like. it's okay thank you. now. now. well. he's a lot of fun and he really likes me and i really like him and we play a lot of games and talked a lot and actually doing a book club now so we're going to skype and may god is more time with him that way but just being around him is fun. well she probably say that i know how to have fun but that i can be serious. and. that i care about others and that i'm loyal and. i'm not sure what else. i think those those are probably the main things. i wish i had more self-discipline so i wish that you know i could die it or eat healthier foods and not have a problem with sugar because i love to eat sugar i wish that i would not procrastinate because i've gotten a lot better about that but i still do and i can be challenging and i wish that i. i don't know. i wish that i was in a relationship so. probably those things. so the last organization i used to work at i had a boss and she was i don't feel like she was. i don't think we were very compatible and she used to push my buttons or so i thought and so. a one day she was really upset about something because a board member had called her up and asked her a question if she didn't have the answer and he was upset about something and it was something to do with my department so she called me into her office and let me know how unhappy she was but it wasn't i i've been a manager for many years and i have very strong opinions about how you handle challenges with with staff members and the way that she handled the situation with me was really inappropriate i thought i meant she clearly was trying to frighten me and make me feel incompetent or at least that's the way that i felt about it and. i did you know i tried to be very calm and said that i would take care of it and i did take care of it but after that our relationship wasn't really the same and i ended up leaving there to go back to the old organization that i work for not that long afterwards because i just didn't really have a lot of respect for her after she did that to me or after we had that interactions. so i heard this piece of advice the other day and or this thing and then i thought it's really profound and i wish that i had read it back then which is when you think about buying something instead of thinking oh here's this beautiful coat it's $100 i want it i'm going to buy it i don't think of it is costing $100 think of it is costing 10 times that because that's effectively what your money could do if you didn't spend it on that coat but instead invested it you know intelligently you would have 10 times that much money eventually so you should really think about it in those terms and i think i've been much more consumer than a saber and so i wish that i had to been more aware of that 10 or 20 years ago. probably. they asked me to be his god parent and his guardian if anything should happen to them and that meant a lot to me because of it made me feel like they trusted me and thought that i was a good person the kind of person that could take care of their child should something happen to them so. let's see. well it wasn't really recently but in february i went i like to travel and a friend and i went to singapore and i got to fly first class is miles of frequent flyer miles to get the tickets and so that was really enjoyable because the seats fold down to sleep the food is delicious you get special attention and i also hadn't been to singapore before so that was kind of cool to. sure thank you bye. hey.,0,0,1,0.7074556,0.29254436,,,,,477

some shows on the way going to texas and stayed out there for 8 days. and that was really nice of you crazy i don't even know man is so much happiness you know i had fun. i went to this place called the salton sea and me a bunch of my bicycle friends we all we got in the car is in the way out into the desert and we yeah it was tight we were burning stuff we burn the car we drove the car was like a road warrior type of car and this is crazy man like it was like 50 niggars on one car it was like gnarly we got naked when do you stream i did have a shrooms did have a molly smoke a ridiculous amount so we'd got retarded drunk so i try to give me some mexican i don't want to do that but this is like in march before i went on the other trip is like the precursor to my other trip it was the salton sea trip but it was tight. i saw a lot of nakedness that trip. yeah really. i'm hell out going how going for sure. smoke weed. okay. what did i study. photography photojournalism and yeah is that it got to use a computer for free. to get use bother as cameras for free and i was the doolittle i would do man-on-the-street type shit with students not man on the street but the ones that you take a picture and say like i forgot what it was called it was long ago. nah nah nah nah nee more. this being me and jay hanging out. i rap that's what i do i do little shows around the country and stuff i got a little fan base and i'm sorry you know i'm just doing that he's doing all right i draw to my my dream job is not working a job and being me that's the dream job getting paid for being me

broken up. that was the last time. i got angry. it was cool as fun. life. maybe that maybe that situation could have been handled differently it could have been handled differently if they would have been handling things differently than i wouldn't have to react it's not like i was mad i was acting awful reaction i had to act like that because like justice that i couldn't it was on jessie was like i'm not a mean person at all but when i saw one of my loved ones to get it tagged i had the black come and like you know like react to that and they were the hot and i mean i was like yeah yeah i think is a tripping like yo chill out is the tiny little white dude your humongous ass mexican eggs are you need to fall back and i mean it's crazy. guilty. i don't know i still should sometime from stores when i'm hungry so i got no money i got and i really guilty actually yeah i don't feel guilty about that food should be free and i mean i don't know i like everybody laughs sometime i lie sometimes i feel like a little like idle here and there exaggerations. nah nah never. the hardest. i guess i don't even know what the hardest decision was but i get face with hard decisions and those would be like i got so many friends sometimes i can't really hang out with everybody in one weekend cuz i got to make this is like if i go over this sector the town i'm going to hang out with xyz

good and it's tight i don't know. something i could erase for my memory i want to want to erase anything from my memory. cuz that'll be like because like the experiences you go through make you who you are who you are i think we've people like that want to erase things or block things out like that doesn't exist i mean there should that's been hard but i would never say i would not want that to happen cuz you know you must have got to learn from the experience you know i mean to be the better you all i see is like a it's like a test you know that bad experience was just testing you got over come and be stronger and not just like curl up and be like oh my god life hard that shitt i don't believe in that i have compassion for people who do get a who do want to do stuff like that but i still like i don't see the logic in it. i mean i stay up pretty late and do all sorts of a regular stash it but when i am home it's really easy i can just go to sleep you know when i get tired i get

33,169,okay. okay. okay. that's pretty cool. i'm going to start the recording okay. she said say. okay okay so just wait for her to ask question just answer okay. okay. thank you. okay. yes i am. something good. i'm originally from orange county california. and now i live in los angeles. i went to college here so i enjoy the fact that a lot of my friends are still around so just ability to see them and be able to hang out with them is really good obviously the weather has been amazing all the time so those are a few things i like about la. right. obviously traffic. and i don't know i think traffic is the main reason and aside from that i don't have much to complain. all my used to for my old job but not anymore so i'm pretty much based in la most of the time. i'm just a bility to see other things and explore new things whether it be going to a new site seeing area or trying different kinds of food just the fact that i'm in conjuring something else or something you is something i enjoy about traveling. and obviously the people that i am with when i am going traveling cuz i rarely travel by myself so you know whether i travel with my boyfriend or friends the fact that i have companions that i enjoy spending time with you something i enjoy. sure i for the 4th of july past weekend or two weekends ago actually went to san francisco to visit my boyfriend so we actually he was moving from la to san francisco so we drove up to the bay area saw his family and then stayed with my friend who recently moved into a new apartment in oakland so we hung out with her spend the day in the city went to the ferry building went to the fisherman's wharf and hung out and went shopping so although you was kind of a bittersweet goodbye cuz we are now i'm now in la and he's in san francisco but it was a really fun trip. from the past trip or just in general. i studied mathematics and economics. i am actually i just quit my job last friday i'm taking some time off before i go back to graduate school. my dream job. let me think for a second i think i'm really interested in social commerce and retail so something that combines my interests and also gives me the ability to spend time with people i love my previous job i was working a lot so i was always constantly working and i didn't really get to see anyone or do anything on my own or as i have a hobby but i don't have a job that would give me the flexibility to pursue what i want to do outside of my professional life. outgoing. i don't know what i mean you people or when i just hang out with people in general i'm not. i'm not shy to speak about my feelings or you ask questions or engage in a conversation initiate a conversation so i don't consider myself shy. sure my family and i are pretty close there back in orange county but i've been living apart from them for about a ready for years but i still visit them almost every other weekend we go out to dinner and then i hang up my mom we have our shopping strips and spa days once in awhile so we get to bond so i think i have a pretty close relationship my family most importantly my mom she's like almost like my best friend. i work in the entertainment industry when i work at a youtube production studio which we make content for youtube vloggers or whatever you call it so i just kind of go on youtube and look at my favorite youtube vlogs from people it's kind of like a mini reality show so i think it's pretty fun other than that i just kind of go through my old pictures to think about like fun times i've had bruised apple from my trip to costa rica last year at my boyfriend or my trip san francisco with my friends or just kind of think about like. good times i've had in the past or also i enjoy like exercising of being in nature so i would go for a hike in santa monica or something like that. i think i'm pretty. good i've never had a situation when i was out of control or now is. i was acting like i was in myself i think when i don't know i don't think i've actually never had a situation when i was i wasn't able to control my temper i just kind of stay calm and think about the situation and think about how i'm going to respond to it and try to respond to it wisely. let me think i i don't i can't really remember the last time i argue just saw on maybe when i argued in my old remain about our friendship kind of so we had a conversation about how both of us are kind of drifting apart from each other but it was more of a conversation than the argument so we were able to run both of us are kind of like getting heated up by the topic but we was just kind of cool down and talk about the situation and talk things through. oh yeah sure so i remember a few months ago a friend of mine visited from washington dc and we enter a different friends house in hollywood so when i was there there was this guy who kind of was very confrontational with me about what i do or what i want to do or my stands on certain topics for example was education and then and he started kind of saying like oh you know you're not secure about the way you are by blah blah so i kind of was i kind of got angry at them and i just told him. like you're not giving me a good first impression and you're what you're saying doesn't make sense and i kind of like was very argumentative with them i wish that i was more common was able to kind of. pro more on why he thought that way instead of attacking him verbally. guilty i'm guilty about quitting my job too early i'm going back to graduate school and the fall so i was actually supposed to stay a little later till end of july but hey i wanted to enjoy my time and just be unemployed for a little bit so i ended up quitting my job a little early which is a burden on my boss so that's something i feel guilty about. tell me about the hardest decision. sure i can talk about my recent graduate school preparation process i was deciding between glee which is in the bay area and he witches in boston. like i mentioned before my boyfriend lives in the bay area and then he probably would have a i can be together with him in the same area but i think once i got the acceptance letter i knew that i wanted to go there just right away so i had to decide between being on my boyfriend and being complacent and kind of comfortable in california vs venturing out into different city different state different people different environment and b&b in massachusetts and i ended up deciding with. although it's far away from my parents family friends boyfriend but i wanted to explore something else and being a different environment. i don't know if i have anything i want to completely erase from my memory may be my great grandma passed away when i was in the eighth grade i remember i was in a different room but my grandma passed away in a different room but had i stayed there with her i could have kind of see her passed away but i didn't get to do that cuz i was watching tv and some other room and just hanging out i wish i could erase it from my memory cuz it was kind of a traumatic event in my life. no i haven't. i've never served in the military. i did not. i have never served. oh i wouldn't know because i didn't listen to military. no. i've never served in the military. i didn't serve in the military. i didn't serve in the military. you know just i quit my job i had a good going away party i'm getting ready for grad school a lot of exciting things ahead so i'm excited and happy. not really i think i've been a lot more positive than before. very easy. i'm grumpy and i eat a lot more and i drink a lot of coffee. no. no i have not. 2 months ago when i got my acceptance call from my dream school. i think first and foremost my mom she's always reminded me of who i am and. you know why i am on this earth. and it sounds kind of philosophical but she's been my foundation. they would say energetic kind of intense sometimes outgoing. yeah. i enjoyed. when i went hiking two days ago and. i want my friend stephanie it was a two-hour hike it was a lot of fun and i always loved hiking so that was something i really enjoyed recently. nice. i'm most proud of the fact that i was able to. aquaman aquaman at myself internal environment i actually came when i was i came here when i was in when i was 13 so the fact that i got to where i am in life despite not having not learning how to speak the language about 10 years ago that is something that i'm very very proud of. goodbye. hello cat takes

34,172,start a chat with you for a bit and then. okay. yes. i'm fine this is a little bit strange you know talking to a virtual human. i was born i was born that way i was raised out in the suburbs i've lived all over los angeles live in the valley long beach and now i'm in culver city. there's great food here the weather is great most of the time is a lot of sunshine it doesn't get cold i don't have to shovel snow there are lots of opportunities a lot of diversity all different sorts of people i think that's really great. that is a much longer left i would like to get out of here the the traffic heading that's number one i think everybody hits in traffic and everybody's so busy all the time it's really hard to to get together with anybody everybody so devoted to their jobs and then we're sitting in traffic a lot too. i just graduated actually i study marine biology. i was i went to school and i recently studied graphic design and i found that kind of unfair feeling so i took a trip for a while traveled around the world and started scuba diving and i realize that i really love marine biology so that's how i got into it. everybody's been asking me that a lot lately since i just graduated i think i would like to i think maybe managing a managing a research. you know i'm not i'm not really sure i think i would like to. something in tropical marine ecology maybe like managing a preserve something like that hard question to answer. i do. i like meeting new people and seeing different parts of the world. i travel for 8 months in central america and i visited a lot of different countries i. i went scuba diving. i think i think intolerance injustice in the world those are probably the things that get me the most fired up. brett's my boyfriend does that count. i'm pretty good it takes it takes a lot to really get me fired up to the point where i am going to blow my top of the very few people have seen me angry to the point where i'm kind of yelling and screaming and i don't know i just don't get there i think that i'm a little bit afraid of losing my temper so i keep it under control. if it was yesterday ashley i argued with my boyfriend about getting getting a job i was talking about taking a job somewhere and he was being very supportive and i really wanted him to to say no don't go take that job for 6 months cuz i miss you and he was just being supportive so we kind of argued about that it was ridiculous so we i ended up laughing and that was the end of the fight. meditate exercise go out in nature just unplug at myself away from computer away from technology way from people. i would say not really i'm an only child and it's just me and my parents and we're very very dissimilar for example i'm a pretty adventurous person and i like learning and my parents are couch potatoes they like to watch reality television so we don't have too much to talk about or things that we can really do as far as shared activity so you know i love them and everything but there's not too much common ground. guess i think about our social introvert but i seem to find most social encounters to be draining where is my my boyfriend for example he drives a lot of pleasure and energy from being around people from me it's always a little bit the opposite i have to recharge. not sure i have a best friend but i guess i'll see my boyfriend he's he's kind of my default best friend he would probably say passionate intelligence he always tells me that i'm really hard on myself which is true dedicated loyal. i think i'm just proud of who i am going to i don't know if that's the answer that most people have but i think that i'm i'm really proud of who i am i try really hard i've done a lot of things in my life i'm a really good person i think it's kind of rare to find people that are kind and i consider myself a kind person that that cares about others and wants to make the world a better place so i'm i'm proud of that. no i have not. no. yes. i was probably about 15 at the time so i think he was that 17 years ago. yes. i was cutting and my one of my best friends called called my parents and let them know and at that point they took me in for treatment that wasn't the first time i had ever been to a therapist or a psychiatrist but before it was more they thought i'd adhd so it was i think my parents really took me and rather than me seeking help. i haven't for about 3 years i stopped because it felt like i was check in with a parole officer i just wasn't enjoying the relationship i had but i still have a psychiatrist that i go to for med checks. i do think it's useful if you have the right therapist i think if you don't have a good relationship with your therapist you can be incredibly harmful i have talked to people that have had bad experiences and and won't ever go back. lately i've been a little bit down since a little bit more down than usual because i graduated and my routine of go to school and do school things 24/7 has come to an end and without the routines been a little bit weird finding out what to do with my finding a way to be productive and knowing what to do with my time it's also been a little bit depressing finding out that my intelligence and good grades in school doesn't translate to real-world skills and there aren't that many jobs for marine biologist in california. almost impossible ever since i was a little kid i had to chaya trouble falling asleep and about four years ago it became really really bad where i just couldn't sleep through the night i was getting about 4 hours of sleep sometimes i would wake up every hour and i wake up in the morning just to complete wreck so for about 4 years i've been taking trazodone so i can sleep. have you ever seen fight club your virtual human so you probably haven't seen that but it's it's pretty much like that i. i'm just a complete panic anxious reggae i lose my ability to deal with. at least my ability to deal with things i'm much more likely to lose my temper i can't regulate my moods i'm just really volatile. probably a few months ago i think that i may have been on a trip gone away for a weekend and forgot to take my medicine with me or something like that and then i can't sleep in so that's what happens. really happy i mean it's easy for me to be easier for me to keep track of when i feel really really bad really happy i guess i felt happy on new year's really happy on new year's eve which was. 10 days ago i was with my boyfriend and some friends and we took a trip out to palm springs and joshua tree and it was really nice to see them i don't get to see them very often because i've been in school and i've been so busy as it was really nice reintroduction to real life. i think that i am i'm kind and considerate i'm tolerant i'm pretty open-minded i'm aware of my faults i just tried to be nice to everybody and. i'm very curious about about the world and things that i don't know about i really like to learn. off the top of my head first thing that came comes to mind is diving the blue hole in belize that was really amazing it was me and my friends we just jumped off the boat and you come up over the edge of this limestone sinkhole and its really really really blue and you just drop down to about a hundred and forty feet in. something like two minutes we did it pretty quick not everybody could do it that quick and as you go down then you see all these stalagmites and stalactites and they're huge there larger than a human at cuz it's this cave system and its really murky and there sharks swimming around 2 or so. that's pretty good. i'm trying to remember that the moment i haven't had much free time the last three and a half years being in school is reading hiking just being together with my friends doing relatively low key things going to movies having dinner parties cooking thing with my cat. not that i can really think of i'm sure i've made mistakes in my life but you know i'm still here so can't be that bad. i know hang in there i hold onto your clothes cuz the 90s are coming back in fashion. cloudy weather beautiful sunsets being in being out in nature kind of being away from the hubbub of the city. getting a good grade. i think my boyfriend has he's just especially the last year he's really inspired me he quit drinking he quit smoking he's made a lot of positive changes in his life and i know that those things aren't aren't hard or aren't easy i should say so to see someone overcome that really inspired me.

36,175,alright how you doing. northern illinois. two and a half years ago. haven't yet since i've been here. haven't had a chance to going to go back later this year. colder or warmer. work. took a little while but i got used to it. no weather variations comparative traffic. sunlight. a little bit. seeing different things. been to europe a couple of times. been around the country. visiting yosemite and sequoia parks for fun. depends on the circumstance most of the time i can fake outgoing or try to be outgoing. try to relax and breathe through it and move on. depends on the context. probably yesterday my children about them not doing what they were told to do. arguments with my wife where i should have probably been more patient and understanding. sometimes when it's more of a hormonal. like this week i should just probably breathe through things and recognize that she's going through things and i should just be more patient. what else can i do with my life. zz when i was 19 i could just decide to do strange difficult things and had the boldness to follow through with him. hebrew and semitic studies and classics. kind of. i'm in ministry. that's working out the way i kind of wanted to be. some embarrassing things when i was a teenager probably. what is wrong. i talked to my parents about once a day maybe once every other day and. i'm constantly talk with my wife and children. got four of them they keep me very busy between 9 and 3. sometimes most of the time now. character development recognizing that they need space to grow. when it works and you see character development and growth and. an exploration. i have more standards more willingness to enforce standards. my wife. she's been there for me for 15 years now and. help give me the self-confidence to be who i am. better now that i'm not drinking as much pop tonight. irritable. shorter temper. pretty good pretty good now i'm doing and making some better decisions with my diet is doing better. feel a bit more empowered not as defeatist i was in a process where i wasn't eating very well as an exercising wasn't able to get doing those things i've been doing a little better at that recently passed you weeks and that's been a little bit more encouraging. have you ever been. no. really happy. probably a few weeks ago at the beach when everybody was having a good time. confident. loud. intelligent. i guess. more patient. more able to. automatically engage with people as opposed to being hesitant at first. oh middle school and i was always the. low man on the totem pole socially. being a constant butt of jokes. don't fall in the trap of thinking that middle high school is life. send you a bill weekend. sometime you know if was children and family doing some fun activity beecher museum or something. some time with the wife sometime just by myself to read and kind of refocus. something you did. participate in some high-level academic discussions. driving able to. maintain the standard and quality of life for myself and my family have been able to do so far.,0,0,1,0.73147106,0.26852897,,,,,490
37,185,yes i'm okay with this. i'm pretty ass a little tired but some pretty good for the most part. on redondo beach. yep. at the beach or the mountains i love it go surfing in the morning or snowboarding the day. if you're hiking up in these mountains santa monica mountains to be exact. i don't like the traffic i don't like the congestion a few people here and i don't like. the price of the cost of living in specific areas. i'm sure you can tell by my. i've been trying to actually. last year was the summer of really road trippin and getting out there if my girlfriend. we're looking at a costa rica and hopefully south america this summer and then maybe even doing a road trip down the south seas in the southern states but i've been in a canada been to mexico and ecuador iron. been to various states here and they're trying to get out there. i love meeting new people i love experiencing new things trying different different foods that are native to that local area and. she's part of the journey i just i love exploring this you know this planet we call earth. just recently went to seattle and canada with a couple friends and. who's gorgeous we have flew into seattle and we saw the city for the first two three days and then rented a car and headed over to vancouver canada and saw british columbian why was he gorgeous just very large beautiful trees the. the climate was nice the ocean was right there's people are great it's just a fun trip all around. one of my most memorable experiences. was probably the. the trip we took the colorado last summer and me and my girlfriend flew into denver and we didn't really have a plan we knew we knew of a couple people were living there and just the day before we had contacted them and tell them we're coming the area and they're just showed great hospitality they picked us up at the airport lettuce crash at their place for a couple days we even let us use their card it's for the state and go to wyoming and see the neighbors to the north it was just a great trip great people and it was just everything worked out very well just everyday is there something new and fun to do. yeah. i study business management and economics right now. i'm i've always wanted to own my own business and i figured mansion pa. agera foundation to build on and i'll learn more about so i decide to go to management just to see the various aspects of what it takes to really manage your own business and then economics was just too just for long-term investments are really want to start running some stocks and etfs and mutual funds and start building my profolio up so i figured now that would be great way for a long-term investment financially so that's why did my economics. yeah i'm really stoked was. one of the best decisions probably mine my life. i consider myself more outgoing them i'm pretty friendly hiking don't mind to open up to people and stuff. how to be outside like to go hiking want to go working out the gym but i most like to be outdoors i love nature and just be outside just. just puts me at ease. from pretty good for the most part i'm pretty mellow chill guy and when i do get angry here and there. it just lasts for like a couple minutes and before i know it i just it just blows over i don't tend to hold on to things or stay angry and hold grudges just cuz there's no need to life's too short for all that. see i can't remember the last time i argue with anybody. i have no idea. probably when maya. my brother and my girlfriend got a little little argument i'd like to birthdays ago and it's been awkward kind ever since. i wish you would just handle that right then and there rather than letting it just stretch out as long as it has been it's just awkward for both parties i was just go to communicate with both of them and told them that the differences aside and was just communicating try to come up with a solution. but now it's just awkward. yeah it does. tell me about the hardest. the hardest decision i've ever had to make. and the tuffy. i don't think i've had too many tough decisions really say the hardest decision i've ever had to make on maybe. not moving to colorado for my undergrad to three years ago was a little touch of slick kind of think what if. but other than that nothing has really been too tough on my life that was really that hard of a decision. when you feel guilty. don't really feel guilty about anything pretty good person i think and for the most part i can think of any then. so now i could wish i could erase my memory. nothing really be honest. i love all my memories are usually positive for the most part i know it's kind of. wait for somebody to say but i've looked pretty good life and. i'm happy. yeah. it's cool i'm pretty independent the most part so when i do see him here in the ants if we go through long periods of times with no contact maybe a couple weeks sometimes even a month but i want to see if it's good you know i like to say hi and show him i love him still and it's not that i don't mean to like not contact him that you're always contact me but. it's good for the most part i guess is a young adult. my girlfriend's family. they've been very positive in my life i wasn't for them i think of you in a different direction. just in high school i didn't really care about higher education i didn't care about. really thinking long-term. and i just seeing them and what their family dies and how they think differently like through higher education and how to get somewhere in life and if you do these things is to work at will you too and they've been very successful they own their own no accounting practice and. seen that influence me to achieve higher in life. pretty easy for the most part i just close my eyes and. wake up in the morning. i'm tired sometimes. it's enzyme a little drained and. maybe a little groggy in there. and that's it. showing pretty good for the most part a little stressed out just cuz finals around next week and i really really want to do well and just seen a close out this last semester and i graduate in two weeks and for the most part that's that's one thing i'm really nervous about but for the most part i'm really excited and looking forward to going to maui for a week after graduation fired up and fired up to see what the future holds we're going to be my girlfriend 11 weather trips are planned for the summer i'm just excited be done with school for a little while. yeah. i have never been diagnosed with ptsd. i've never been diagnosed with depression. the last time i felt really happy with paci my girlfriend graduate couple days ago she had just graduated from nursing school on monday and i just hear walk across stage and stuff just cuz we've been together for 6 years tina go through the nursing program for 5 and it's just ups and downs it's really good to see somebody just drive through and achieve what they wanted to cheat and just been really proud of her. yeah. probably outgoing friendly positive vibes all around adventurist. love sports team player knows how to be a leader in there. and it's a little outspoken sometimes. not really for the most part. no not really. feeling more motivated to do something motivating right now i'm just because i'm just done with school and i'm over at that i just don't feel as motivated but i just want to be more motivated and determined. right now and that's not. i'm not going that way right now so. no biggie. how man i couldn't. can really think of a time. owen caving 2 weeks ago that was a lot of fun we went up to sequoia national park and i went caving with the trainer cna classes like this site recreation tourism management class and kayden with an elective and our professor was at the world-renowned cave specialist and they took us to these various caves in the sequoia and just me and these strangers are my classmates and becoming really good friends with him was a lot of fun and rappelling down in a cats climb back up going through different rooms and shoots it was a lot of fun. dallas yeah. 10 or 20 years ago i'd probably say to stay more focused on school little lesson the social aspects and kind of stick with one sport to see how far that he got you. sometimes not playing hockey hockey sometimes. and that's pretty much at now. i'm proud that i'm really proud that i'm graduating my bachelor's and i'm looking to get a full-time job or get a law firm now so i have something going for me. really try to be motivated and determined person long-term long-term thinking lies and well-rounded person. and i don't want to spoil the world some car proud that i open my eyes to that and now i have different perspectives and really about open-minded people and rather than judging i mean on celebrity why not let them do what they want anna. i'm really proud to just be a finally getting my bachelor's and hopefully going for my mba in a couple years. thanks for sharing your thoughts. for sure. bye. all right house interesting.,0,0,1,0.7643521,0.23564793,,,,,468

coming in today. created to talk to people and say. i'm not a therapist. and please feel. are you okay with this. flying today today is my daughter's birthday. that's great. california. yes. the beach. i love the waters. the game violence. violence. can you tell me about. i lost a lot of friends going up in through elementary and high school just losing them through gang violence. i'm sorry to hear that. yeah thank you. best free papa bear. i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot. haven't been to any place out of california yet so not really. optician i'm a certified optician and i also have my associate's degree. how did you do. actually i women i didn't really know what i wanted to do when i first applied i just want to change my life and do something successful before i settle down and i have my daughter and everything actually my guidance counselor kind of help me and i i always thought like they were so cool cuz they're white long lap. what's your dream job. sylvia optometrist. unto them are you not touching and that's like the first step and why is it the question is because then i would have a beer with have my own business and i'll have something successful to leave so my daughter and she wouldn't have to really want for anything it will be like a family business but i'll tell the community as well and something i can leave for my daughter. my daughter she's five years old should we start an elementary school next week and today is her birthday or five years ago i had her. very smart i taught her home i homeschooled her for 5 years and she's adorable she's my heart. do you find it easy to be a parent know this is like the hardest job ever is very hot. providing providing making sure that you washed your clothes because i miss hard enough to be a parent but i'm a young parent and i'm a little more mature than her father so. it's fine if it's the providing part i will basically say making sure that you have everything that they need is so complicated i let alone and gives you a busy ass home to be more to go the extra mile leaving being here today i probably would have still been in bed but his party and i was trying to make whatever extra little money i can make you know to make sure that you have a good day so it's all about going to extra mile. anything that you can do it up her to provide for their but it's a very hard job. that moment when your child tells you how much they care about you and my daughter her favorite things to tell me about i'm her heart you know it i want to eat you make a call your name ages it's a sense of reality to be called mama ritz-carlton call dad and it is like it if i swear she also let you know that this is really i love you this is my life this is what i'm living right now and. if a if i have a very good feeling that's the best part of being a parent. thank you. a lot of different things i'm actually taking care of my daughter. i'm here with her i was raised by my grandparents so i mean i didn't really get to know my mom since i was 16 and. my father i mean i couldn't point them out or the street or sidewalk so i don't know who he is i feel that i'm very different from them because no matter how hard the job is getting i don't give up. there's boob there's been a lot of different people that have been very positive in my life i can say my sister she was a good influence on me to get into the medical field she's in a lot of she's an lvn and she's one of my older sisters. i can say. me believing in god. being in my life god being in my life has also kept me strong enough to know that i don't have to take on this world by myself because god is there for me and. i don't know. i don't really like them to a lot of different people because. people are hateful. that's the most random thing that's in positive for me. are liam outgoing i used to be shy coming up as a kid and i don't know i don't know what happened to me one day as it's broke out of my shell and i've been. very accurate of showing my personality off. not hawaii but it's the best i've got. what do you do to relax. i actually like four. the waves to collapse against the rocks at the beach and i like to just sit there. and the zone everybody else out there. and rub my toes in the sand and that is so relaxing. how are you at controlling. give me some of that. i learned not to cuz it's a form of it's a form of knowing who's in control and is it your life for the someone else is and i feel that my temper me controlling my temper. are you showing it i'm in charge of my life so i don't even let stuff get to me i don't even really remember the last time do i have to control back somebody because that's how much i try to block out the negativity. probably. fire daughter's father you know the dishes are physical altercation like what. okay. what's something you feel guilty about. wow. i kind of feel guilty about helping like a recipe how things ended before my mom passed i wish that. i could have helped her a little more even though it people tell me not to feel bad because she was really there for me growing up but i kind of feel guilty like you know not being there as much as i could have been for her before she passed away so i think that's something that i still feel guilty for. okay. tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. going through my mom passing away. i felt like i felt like. basically that. it was so kind of. robinson's like i fell everyone else have parents and i grew up with my grandparents and then i'm going to go so many years without actually going to mom and dad for me to get 18 years old and then then she leaves me it was kind of like. i don't know it was nerve-racking because. i felt robbed in oleg i didn't have her all these years and then now that i'm older and i don't even have right now. so. ever had. find me the paper of having a c-section when it was time for me to have my daughter i was so nervous so scared i really didn't know what to do i have to take it i mean like. that was so scared. i know the safest way of bringing my daughter into this world. are you happy. yes. how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep. card i didn't even sleep last night that's why i'm yawning but. i kind of tend to. how to do everything and i have to get back to the stage word. i have to think about myself as well. can buy soap on. what are you like when you don't sleep well. a little like this but actually a little nicer today. groggy. okay. lately i've been feeling very confident about being positive about going the extra mile of being a good parent. have you noticed any changes in her behavior. i actually really don't care what other people think anymore i used to let that bother me and i don't know more. no. also happy that my daughter is this world today on her birthday. guinness no people. is there

40,198,i'm just supposed to watch her i'm supposed to do something. oh okay okay. and again when she says goodbye just press this button and i'll come back and go you're welcome. yes. i'm okay. hello. oh there's a lot of variety there's a lot of health oriented stuff. there's all kinds of food to eat you can go to the desert and go to the you can go anywhere i mean there's a lot. and the weather is great. the traffic. lately the change in weather it's kind of a little too unpredictable but it mainly the traffic and sometimes some rudeness of people. i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world. i want say a lot just occasionally. it's nice to get a change of scenery and different things to do that maybe i wouldn't normally do different people learning about different people different customs. depends i mean if it's the water real pretty water and you know being in beautiful water relaxing adventure i love adventure. some time ago i went to cayman islands and. went on i get seasick but my sister gave me some medication i went on a boat and we snorkeled and there were two boats and i accidentally got back on the wrong boat yeah and they're really crazy they made me jump back into the water and swim to the right boat and i thought i was going to drown because the water was kind of rough i was really shocked that they wanted me to do that. yeah but i survived. you're pretty good. business management. but also also hypnotherapy. i didn't hear that other question. well i came from a serious kind of families so that just seemed something that would be a universal that will cover a lot of different subjects. yes yeah but yes or no i mean now i kind of wish it was something different. i like communication i love speaking and interviewing strangers i'm very outgoing and funny so probably would have been something more like either liberal arts communication that type of thing. dream job which is be out there you know like some of these people may be on tv exploring different places and getting paid for it and always like a fun adventure interacting with people doing things i haven't done before and helping people you know on some way with what i do you could that they can see you know. but i'm uncoordinated and in some ways and you know they could be uncoordinated and have some fun too. i watch tv i go workout go walking i recently like a bike that i kind of sort of fixed up go do something new go to a festival go grocery shopping in iraq with friends call them see them. that type of thing. talk to strangers. depends on the situation there's a bunch of time so i'm good at it if it has to do with like traffic and cars it's a little more intense for me. or people were like really rude you know with the way they cut you off. almost. luckily not you know i'm very assertive and maybe too much sometimes we're if somebody does something really rude to me in a parking lot i'll i'll confront them on that sometimes. might have been with my sister. i had to do with i'm not sure of the topic but whatever she was saying wasn't right and we got in an argument it sounds childish about who was right you know cuz she thinks she's always the smarter one cuz she's older. sometimes it's frustrating cuz it's like it's a no-win situation she just wants to hammer on somebody till you know they acknowledged that she's right other times i just let it go and let her ride along cuz it's. those kind of non productive. i'm real close to i see my parents almost every weekend more close to my mother. i have a twin sister i stay in touch with her even though she's out of town she lives out of town and i've got two other sister so i stay in touch with all of them you know it's a mixed bag you know. be kind of assertive aggressiveness in us in a little bit. but also. well me and ever i mean stranger sometimes my family you know they've done nice things for me to strangers have been very sometimes unexpectedly very nice. i could be shopping and you know maybe i can't reach something and some guy i'll pop up behind me and you know without me saying anything just help me out. that type of thing or. if somebody's like kind of mean to me somebody all like commiserate you know. anti. i had a situation years ago with a neighbor where he was really nasty to me cuz he thought i didn't like his dog was you know i'm not crazy about dogs but he kind of flipped out for a year-and-a-half and just said very nasty things to me when other people weren't around i wish i had confronted that back then because i yeah but it create a lot of anxiety for me cuz i feel like i could have nipped it in the bud and instead of having to deal with the. major stress from it now he and i don't talk at all i just feel it's best it's kind of odd. god there's been a lot. sometimes breaking up with somebody or. yeah sushi or getting rid of a friend. that type of thing. sometimes i feel guilty about some of my past behavior with people. or maybe i wasn't his understanding. when i was younger i stole things you know that's not the best behavior and. kind of stuff like that. oh god there's a lot of them. i wish i could have raised you know how tough my dad was on us as children. and erase a lot of memories of men i dated that just didn't work out well at all. now. i can drop off like right away. cranky irritated. snarky. i've been out of sorts some i've had some anxiety with money and relationships cuz i haven't been in one for so long male. just a lot of anxiety. take a deep breath trying to do positive things so you know sometimes eat healthy or work out more talk to my friend about it. that type of thing try and look for interesting activities to do to distract me. will not officially but i know you know from things have experience that i've had you not get very anxious and certain situations. yeah it's usually triggered by. sometimes if somebody gets really angry and crazy it triggers a lot of anxiety in me if they're aggressive whether it be physically or verbally or sometimes if they're too much in my my space you know where i am if it bothers me. yeah a long time ago. ages ago. maybe over 10 years ago 15 years ago. i was depressed i mean it's nothing to laugh about but i mean it's kind of. a circle just to want to be more positive and enjoy life more. feeling stuck in certain thoughts i'm having a lot of negative thoughts feeling of hopelessness helplessness. that type of thing. i go occasionally it's a different type i'll go see a hypnotherapist sometimes to release anxiety that's in me. yes i do very useful. i want more awareness of myself and other people. learning more control more confidence better self-esteem willing to try even more things you know whether i know the outcome or not you know of the unknown i'll experiment a lot more. helping like at the 25th mile heading out water and there are some people there who are doing that for the first time also. some event at my sister's where they were just a couple of us and i was cracking a lot of jokes sometimes i'm like really funny you know and i can't even believe myself and i just go on and you know that one starts laughing i'm not even trying to and i'm just saying like regular stories and people look at me funny laugh yeah. as a really decent loyal empathetic deserving. supportive i'm hoping. outgoing quirky type of person. look be great to look even younger or be younger. if that was humanly possible. be even more patient with people i think you know not get frustrated like if i think somebody is not very smart sometimes it's real frustrating for me to be around some types of people. well. wow. make a lot of money and plan for your future. and. try and be as kind of impatient with people as possible and have a lot of fun trying new things. i think of my mind and my perseverance that i've changed a lot of things within my personality. i feel proud of volunteer work i feel proud i felt a bunch of people lose weight declutter their homes and helped create a lot of positive change in people. okay. it was nice talking to you. when she nods her head a lot.,0,0,1,0.7241675,0.27583247,,,,,469
41,202,next. are you okay. yes. i'm doing pretty good. i'm from oklahoma. yep oklahoma city. the weather is great i love being near the ocean and the palm trees and mountains i just love it here. i was pretty easy there's a few differences of huge city compared to where i'm from so traffic has definitely been an adjustment for me. i just always wanted to live in california hated being landlocked in oklahoma and just wanted to get out to the west coast be near the ocean. i studied psychology and minor in art. no not at the moment. well actually i think i misunderstood your question i'm not still working on my degree but i am working in the field of psychology i know i just got hired working at a group home for teenage boys to has been in trouble with the law. my dream job. i don't really know i think i just want to help people however i can and i just like working with people in the realm of psychology so i think i may already have my dream job. to relax i like to read and watch movies i like to go to the beach and just watch the sunset or hang out with friends. what are some things that. things that make me really mad probably injustice towards other people people being mistreated or abused and people being lied to and deceived including myself i hate being lied to. limonoid depends on the situation but i tried to just like count to 10 and take a deep breath and and not let my emotions caused me to react in a negative way so i just try and like calm down before i say anything. it depends again on the situation and like who i'm angry with most the time i'm pretty good at controlling it but sometimes i think like like most people i lash out at the people that i'm close to the stew at times and those moments i'm not that good at controlling it. when was the last time i argue with someone was probably with my parents i've been having some car trouble lately and i'm also running low on money so i'm sure i don't even remember exactly but i'm sure we kind of probably thought about the fact that i you know need to be more self-sufficient and independent and take care of my own things like car issues. i'm very close with my family they're still in oklahoma but i talked to them on the phone all the time. oh definitely i mean my mom i think she's probably the person that i'm closest to and she just she's a great role model she's a wonderful person and she's very hardworking and very unselfish and i just want to be like her in those ways. probably the time i went bungee jumping over the nile river and uganda i still kind of have flashbacks of that moment just free falling it was like the coolest experience ever and i love doing things that are crazy like that so it was a fun time. yeah well i i have traveled a lot nowadays i don't travel so much anymore but i used to work for a cruise line norwegian cruise line so i would go travel all the time with them and then i also did an 11 month long trip around the world is a mission trip so i just went and helped out and different third world countries is really cool. i just love going to different places seeing new places and meeting all different types of people because it's easy to just like get so absorbed in your own small bubble that you forget that there's a huge world out there and there's all different types of people with all different types of beliefs and it's just really cool to be able to branch out and see and meet those types of people and see just the diversity in the terrain of the earth even in the way that the earth looks in different places is cool. no i have not served in the military. nope. no i never been formally diagnosed although i would say i probably diagnose myself with depression just after having studied at a lot in psychology throughout the years i've probably 99% sure that i have struggled with depression and off-and-on so yeah. lately it's been pretty easy but throughout the years i've definitely had a lot of issues with insomnia just like either not being able to fall asleep or just like waking up constantly throughout the night and so right now i'm not really experiencing too much of that but in the past it's definitely been an ongoing issue for me. i'm not a private person when i don't sleep well leave is extremely like important for me i think maybe more so than a lot of people i'd i like need good sleep to function. i've been feeling really good over the past several months i was unemployed after coming out here and that was really really tough and i just recently got offered my job just like last week so i definitely think i've been going through a lot of crap and just a lot of depression but it's like lifted a lot of has lifted off of me because i don't have that pressure any longer of like how am i going to make ends meet the city's really expensive and i don't have a job and so i feel i feel much more relieved than i have been feeling just good. yeah well i mean just like i said over the past week or so i've become a lot more positive i was kind of like feeling a bit like a hermit in a way it's just hard like being in a new city and not really knowing too many people and of course like i said not having a job kind of causes you to kind of. just like being your own shall i guess and that was kind of how it was how it's been for me and just since i got offered a job i just have so much more confidence in like positivity that things are starting to work out for me up to good. probably a couple of days ago actually i went i went to explore part of the south bay area that i hadn't really been to before and it was i was just going to go for a jog along the beach and it was really foggy outside and then the fog started to lift and it was just beautiful and then i went for a drive up kind of off the sleep cliff for the beautiful scenery that i never seen before and i just like was overwhelmed how pretty it was and i was just like i can't believe that i get to live here so that was definitely a happy moment for me. my best friend would probably say that i'm very daring and bold and fearless that i'm unique and artistic and i don't i've guess i should probably say that i'm a non-conformist i don't really think the way that a lot of people do and i question everything so it's going to be a good or bad thing but. probably just like the fact that i i really tried to live my life with like no regrets and just i tried to live a very exciting life in a way and i think that especially ever since i finished college and have been traveling like i haven't i've tried moving all different places by myself so i think just the fact that i am not really afraid i don't let things hold me back i just if i want something or if i want to do something i just do it and i guess in a way like i like that about myself in the fact that i'm really independent and can just go and do whatever i feel like doing even if it's hard i still i'm proud that i've overcome a lot of those struggles. oh there's like minor things that i regret throughout my life but there's not anything really major cuz i think pretty much everything that i've done i've learned from whether it's good or bad so i wouldn't really change anything. i would say i would tell myself when i was a kid that i. should just keep dreaming big and don't let anything that anyone says like stop me from believing that anything is possible because i guess as i've grown into an adult i've really seen and started to really believe that truly anything is possible and then if you really want something you can go after and you can get it and so i would just tell myself to never give up and just always believe that you can do what you want to do. let's see that's kind of hard. oh i guess i went home recently for christmas back to oklahoma and i got to see some of my friends from college that i hadn't seen in some of them i haven't seen in like since i graduated so much has been like 4 years ago so it was really awesome just to go out with them and we went to dinner and we went out afterwards and just had a good night and it was really really fun. you're welcome by. okay. did she stay up and look okay during that hotel.,1,0,1,0.7436538,0.25634626,,,,,352
42,205,thank you. creative. i'm pleased. are you okay. yes. i'm okay. a los angeles. i don't know. kind of dirty but that's to be expected from a big city. my the last class i need to go to sociology class i'm not really sure where i'm going with school but i'm thinking about sex education. how did you do. i think that is a really important job i feel like. because there's kind of a. stigmata guess about talking about sex at leads to like a lot of unsafe sex more than planned pregnancies so i feel like it's a very important job for. the world. i don't know. okay. i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot. lack of funds. it depends on the people but i'd say that generally more shy of course of people who i know well like we're closer to me i am more outgoing. sometimes when i'm feeling. the best of guy. play with my dogs. i don't know if it's a nice day i'll go for a walk if it's not a nice day then or if it's like cold out or something then maybe watch a show on tv i like or read a book or something. i'd say i'm pretty good at controlling my temper. i can't remember i think the last person i argue with was my boyfriend probably last week but i don't even remember what it was about. you feel guilty about. i don't think i really feel guilty about anything i say that i regret things but i think there's a difference between guilt and regret. like i think guilt is more just like feeling bad but regret is like feeling like you should have made a different decision and i think that can help you in to make better decisions in the future where is guilt you just feel bad for no reason and it's useless. i regret not doing better when i was in high school. i mean not getting better grades i regret. blake getting involved with certain people in the past but i mean i'm not sure that's about it that i can think of right now. you done anything to avoid. yeah i mean i mean in the past yeah i could have made different decisions i mean obviously some things you know you aren't entirely in your control but i'm not going to feel i'm not going to regret things that i had no power over so. i'm not sure if i would want to erase it from my memory. but. i wish that it didn't happen to me was a time that i was raped. tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. i can't really think of any hard decisions. i can't think of any. okay. tell me about. i'm not sure i can't think of any. i have a pretty good relationship with my family not i wouldn't say that i'm really close with my mother but i mean we get along well and i'm very close to my sister we're basically best friends. i think that my mother has been a positive influence in my life. because she was always able to provide for me and she always she didn't like mistake sometimes but i think that she was always there for me when i needed it and she just did her best to raise me so i think she was a big positive influence. how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep. it's been easy lately sometimes i have trouble sleeping but. lately i have had no problems. it depends how long i've gone without sleep i can just be anywhere from like groggy to lake really on edge. and like. extremely tired. i have been feeling pretty good i have like general anxiety kind of all the time but it's not as bad as it has been. in the past. so. i'm feeling mostly pretty good. i think that i've actually been feeling happier lately. i want to say that i'm like really happy all the time i mostly just kind of. like a neutral but i have been feeling more positive lately. i'm actually not sure if i have been diagnosed with ptsd. tell me about. i know that i've been seeing a psychologist for like since i was 16 for depression and i think my first psychologist who i saw for a few years thought that i had ptsd but i'm not sure if she ever made a diagnosis. did you think you had a problem before you found out. i'm not sure. i don't know. yes. it's helpful to talk someone and have them kind of. guide you in talking about something so that you can figure things this figure out your feelings about things sort of i guess for yourself or like why it helps to talk with somebody because you can figure out why you're feeling a certain way about something i mean i think sometimes you can do that on your own but talking to somebody helps i think. not sure. i'm not sure. i'm not sure. i think i would spend it mostly at home. but it would be sunny out and i would go outside a little bit and and play with my dogs and. i probably have my boyfriend over. i eat food that i like like only through that i like like my favorite foods watch. movie or tv show that i like just. kind of have like a relaxing time but that's nice. i would tell myself to. to to do better in school because throat high school is kind of an underachiever and i ended up going to community college like on and off because i would like to have lose interest and then not do well or as well as i could have so i would tell myself to do as well as i could in school because i feel like i am capable of a lot more than i do and i think i could easily have gone missing a scholarship if i have done well in high school so i just tell myself to do good in school and probably wore myself about one or two people that turned out to be not worth my time. i think i am proud of myself for not being bitter and for wanting to live kind of bitter and yes but i guess i'm proud of myself for not being selfish and wanting to make the world a better place like cuz a lot of bad things have happened to me and i tried to instead instead of dwell on them i try to or i want to be able to make things better for other people and as much as i want to help i guess empower people to make their lives better.,0,0,1,0.70360124,0.2963987,,,,,417

lot that i like but i don't like but i like hollywood i like to eat the movie industry. the huge show. different different piano different. different ethnics of people here in ohio. i enjoy talking to

ignorance. being disrespectful being disrespectful or whatever you know other people being disrespectful towards you or other people. okay or i if i'm riding my bike people tend to almost from yours or if i'm not totally paying attention to traffic and all i find myself sometimes. you don't happen to wait to see what they're going to do instead of i have in the right away or stuff like that. yeah big time. what do you do when you're annoyed. what do i do when i'm annoyed. price and third shifter and vent and speak my mind even though i myself wishing that i carried rocks in my back pocket so i can let you know what happened so much where i i just. if it makes me what people will do some time with me oh you almost get run over all you know how i fight almost get run over probably on a daily basis. and i wouldn't mind attention right. how hard is that a try not to react to your reactions. yeah. when was the last time you argue with them. it was my girlfriend and it was about being honest. i'm pretty honest with. i'm open and honest about it anything and everything and what it was about was just her lying to me telling me that she had told our landlord something and i know she done something in that in that aspect and i come to find out a week later that it it was a total why i fell and i just. damn i got it all. yeah. how did you feel in that moment. transducer the word for it. just said i don't know now that whether i can be there because it was. i felt hurt and all that you know it would have been in a relationship for a little bit and that's probably one of my biggest pet peeves is being honest. i don't like i said i don't hold back on for y'all in anything and everything that i do or say so and if you're lying about something and wall-e just your always having to cover up. more lies with the lies that mean that you already told him i. i don't see any kind of. took a lot from me trusting her now and i'll or whatever now i'm like you know it's like truthful with it not know it was going to hurt our relationship. volume. what are some things you like to do for fun. fun. by going to the beach. russian dark but haven't done it in a while i love the paint i got in the watercolor painting and pretty gifted at that and. i want to try some other mediums and let me see you i love fishing. i haven't gone in a while though. i like driving truck no more and my job are you i wasn't really really enjoyed it i don't like driving through cities but i usually when i'm in the middle of the night when she all the star light star gazing i'll see if i can pick out some of those astronomy start off the affair and. i'm a pretty easygoing guy so shooting pool. sunshine. most memorable experiences. good or bad. whatever comes to your mind. most memorable experiences. i'll probably. playing with lions and tigers. wrestling a baby elephant in a in a mud puddle. i just enjoy myself. awesome. not. i don't have much family as it is. at least here in the states i don't know miles from central america so but i'm not close to i have. three brothers one sister. and i'm probably not really really close to none of my siblings i speak with one brother. quite a bit my other youngest brother and i just rather not know you're not this guy try to keep it on a professional basis my sister i don't talk to her at all my other brother underneath me i haven't spoken to him in years. i'm just close my mom my knees some of my nephews and that's about it. okay can you have done anything to avoid it. have i done anything to avoid it. to avoid them. yeah i just don't talk to my don't call my phone ask about on my you know i talked to my mom quite a bit my brother quite a bit but i just don't bring up those subjects or if they are brought up i just know that's on them and i really don't want to do it himself. how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep. it's been hard lately it's been probably hard for the last. going on a year. you know i i i. depends on my thought process at time i liked it i've been looking for work quite a bit so i was just wondering why you know i don't get called i i just have i have racing thoughts. so. or i get depressed you know cuz i are worried about things that you know that really i have no control over so you know. lately i just been sleeping too much for me because i was so used to just sleeping 4 to 5 hours a night too and now it's changed about 8 to 9 hours and i'm still tired. do you feel that way often lately i have them for about the last few months. what are you like when you don't sleep well tired. you know i don't sleep well you know that i just do all back on the same things that have been bothering me so you know i'm more of a guy and i love the work. and if i'm not then i just looked too much time for me to spend in my own head and so. you know. either i'll even if i'm busy i'm doing what i need to do know and whatever job i do like, you know get into it i enjoy it something new for me and. so i can think about you know either work or i can go home and then think about this you know i don't have to worry about no money. your bill is getting paid and i can just concentrate on other things either you know doing the things i like or maybe spending a little more time with my girlfriend or you know so. how do you cook with them. how do i cover them. i just. try not to think about it as it's not about what are coping with it or not i just do is. i'm a horrible guy that just. you know i may take me a moment to. to all. salem cooking something but you know how it is if i have no control over it there's nothing that i can really do about it. one thing i can do is continue to do what i'm doing and that's actively looking for work. going out on interviews talking with others about work so i can just come out and i'll get back to. back to basics you know i just don't like the loss of balme does bother me but i try not to. to let it continue bother me. yes. that got me a. if what has got me in trouble. my mood choice i mean. yeah money i mean my past i got a past history so which kind of tends to. ibobber my my hiring process i don't know them when i get hired so i got to do it a different different type of employers who are felony friendly and stuff like that and i tried you know i was out taking classes on now. oh not how to interview how to how to answer some of the questions which you know come up quite a bit and. i got to reflect back on that but i just i got to keep putting in my head if that's not who who i want to be anymore so or you know i've done. i've done now. i've done my time so to say but i took the time you know the last time i just took a lot of time in and try to work on. the issues that were bothering me lol. positive stuff i got my ged two different things to a lot of classes thought about going to school and going to school and. anything that would cause i change my old ways and and and try to move on to more productive activities. that's good. are you still in here. that. people have been deceitful. can you repeat that one more time. have you been diagnosed with depression been diagnosed with bipolar. how hard is that. stopping me don't you know. i don't medicate so i mean i have been on medication before in the past but. i guess i try to live on while i try to live life on life's terms and i just you know i know the medical establishment always want to label something in and what i don't like about it is that they just experiment with pills and i've been on probably every magical feel that there is for that and. you know how long i've been too strong or something that's coming up and so i just try to cope with things. which is my life skills you know i i don't i don't want to be using probably i know certain drugs work for like 3 to 4 months 6 months and they go load it while i'm going to try on this phone or i'm going to try on that and it's just an ongoing process tonight probably for about the last two years ask about three years i can kind of just said you know what that's it. and i. what are the difference in whether or if i would be on meds for it i don't think so you know it's just still the same stuff i still get the same problem can i still get the same anxiety that's if i if i was on medication for it or not so i just. and i'll deal with it you know sometimes it's not good and i get irritated at people a lot i don't like people i don't like crowds i don't like i'm not just people and empty quiet so. but i got a pretty nice not that i personality but i think people can see me and just say i don't mess with this guy or you know. but she'll you know i like i all right public transportation quite a bit and. now you just get a lot of loud i'm not just people on there sometimes i got to get off the bus that's how i deal with people because i just know there's consequences if i didn't deal with it that way. go i'd rather take the time on get off the bus wait for the next bus and hopefully it's not that bad. i understand. did you think you have a phone before you come back. did i have problem before i get out. well i don't know if i knew that i had a problem before i found out the thing is that i know other people. i have a lot of the same town so i know a lot in my younger days people would tell me you know when i told him that i was diagnosed with bipolar that. a lot of remorse for like all that's what you know that's what was wrong with you know we wish you that you would have found that out years ago. and like i said i don't think the meds really work but what i do i think time, i just getting older kind of makes it work. median with lights. how do you say therapist affected you. how do i talk to a therapist probably on a weekly basis for a while recently. and i don't want to get out my anger my thoughts. a lot of people other people may not understand. a therapist is. i think the biggest thing is that i can just get it all out whatever is problem it would be. people in ohio. other issues you don't work or whatever the case maybe is that i just think talking about it and they're such good listener thinking, like. now that they give me the same advice i give myself or whatever that i would give to others but it's always helpful to hear from somebody else somebody who suppose we have to go to school for. i don't go anymore so i kind of miss it you know like i said. miss mulatto. i just one of those things you know i just deal with it you know according to let you know if i ever get a chance to go to therapy again. charlottsville all monetary reasons and. and all i don't have health insurance and there's a lot of things that you know i like to do but i can't. the money situation is not that great right now so. i'm sorry. how does my friends describe me. they would probably describe me as a. energetic outgoing person once i get to know people. laugh i know apple i laugh a lot. but. it would probably tell you that i'm also very serious and and. hidden person i don't reveal a lot. positive influence in your life. domino's menu. i'll probably my boss one of my bosses when i first trailer with a. what exotic animals he was real and he was. german and. bennigan's. he don't know what he saw in me but. he talked a lot about working with exotic animals and. show a lot of confidence in man with your engine and also build confidence in myself and. sort of let me know that you know this is nothing that i really can accomplish if i put my mind to it. okay i think i've asked everything i need to thanks for sharing your thoughts with me goodbye. she said good-bye and then. we just have a quick postcode for you.",0,0,2,0.79209745,0.20790255,,,,,305
2,12,yes. i'm doing great how about you. i'm born in the us i was born in orlando florida. my parents my dad had a lot of friends in los angeles so decide to move here. he was pretty different i mean the place i was before was very it was a very small town we probably won't even notice it on the map so it was a big learning experience on cuz we know the schools were a lot larger in different cultures and ethnicities so it was a unique experience. last time i've been back was probably about 5 years ago. definitely different my aunt she lives in again and she lives in a small town i'm so if you want to go to a movie theater you have to drive out at least an hour or if you want to go to a mall it's it's an hour drive so i'm the complete opposite of los angeles. convenience everything everything i could possibly want is here the weather is great shopping mall have a lot of friends here sports place just kind of like the perfect area you know you don't want to live here kind of for the rest of my life actually. the big thing would probably be traffic i mean wherever you go there's going to be traffic with it on the 405 for the 101 it's it's just traffic you know i can kill like 2 hours in your day which is huge. quite a bit for a personal info for business site travel you know he usually overseas or domestically my trouble so and i enjoyed a lot. i'm singing different places different areas meeting new people eating different kinds of food being able to sightsee and tour if i have a day or two free i'll miss just experiencing now i'm having new experiences just in riches my life. i'm computers. and i also did english as well. yes i am. i'm at work an it and it department at a semiconductor company. probably working for apple since i pretty much when everything they have be great to work for apple. i'll get it depends there are times when it's good to be alone but for the most part i consider myself an outgoing social person. nothing too much i guess if you kind of make a promising you and you break it several times and i might get a little bit make it a little bit annoyed but i don't think i would get really mad. all the questions i probably say i tend to eat a little bit more. just kind of keep my mind off of a little bit but usually doesn't last that long so it's a product i 10 that you. a little bit more more kind of like maybe junk food or something. i think i'm pretty good i rarely get mad and if i do it doesn't really last that long so i think i'm pretty good at controlling my temper again i really don't get angry so it's not really an issue for me. i said during the elections were talking about president obama and mitt romney and you know who'd be the best fit for the next presidency. that kind of got a little bit i guess a little bit heated but it was more for i guess more fun six and anything else but it was an interesting conversation. i like to eat out a lot watch movies play video games. disco out shop play sports watch the laker game if i can if person would be probably the best bowling photography like doing a lot i like to do a lot of different things and of course like tronics. the outgoing loyal intelligent funny and a great listener. no i have not. no. for most nights it's it's pretty easy just have to avoid drinking coffee or tea before i sleep more than that it's pretty easy. what's a little bit sluggish tired kind of reaction times a little bit slower aside from that nothing nothing too much like two glaring or anything the usual just being sluggish and not moving as quickly as i should. i'm pretty good have no complaints. pretty much the same. i guess today i had my car maintenance today and it didn't cost me anything so that's great and i thought it was going to cost me you know something extra on the side but you know the the service advisor waved it so i got everything free today so i actually have a really good mood. nothing. probably don't spend as much save more money aside from that nothing else just be kind of more wise with your money. i'm replacing my best friend. he's kind of a you know help me out and i help them out as well so it's been kind of a great learning experience. developing our our friendship and he's bailed me out a couple of times i feel them out as well so it's kind of mutual thing we do you know what each other and it's a great way to bond as well. i say probably going back back to korea to visit my relatives you know they are a lot more different than i remember 15 years ago when i was a kid i was actually kind of afraid of some of them but now that i see them you know recently they've actually mellowed a lot and they're actually pretty fun to talk to you so it was kind of a learning experience for me because they're you know do they complete 180 from when i was at when i was a kid. i'm sorry poem. guesswork would be part of it. buying my the car that i wanted to a couple years to save up to buy the car but i i paid it all off so i don't have any more car payment so that's great too and you know being able to help my family all this wall. let's see a couple weeks ago i went to las vegas for the 4 cs which is great if you fancy gadgets electronic song you get to see all the other goodies coming out this year so that was pretty interesting to see and some things that you know when you read on blogs they didn't talk about so you get to see it actually in-person kind of experience it from a user standpoint so i thought it was great and it's just fun is conecuh being a kid in the candy store you get to play with different gadgets so it's really fun for me.,0,0,2,0.8103062,0.18969382,,,,,361

much. creative. and please. are you okay with. yes. doing okay. north carolina. yep. almost four years ago. majin buu. i graduated college and internship out here for production company so i started doing that with the group of friends and then got work after that and enjoy the city so much and have been working on here since. how often do you go back to. probably at the most three times a year maybe twice using the holidays maybe one random trip in there. it's ellie's only now just starting to come home to me in the sense of that respect or like i was going home was going home now going home. going back to see my family and seeing some friends but i might by fillmore i feel like i belong in los angeles i do back at home. things you really like about a leg. add food on the weather goes without saying i factory sources are like feeling i like that the things i want to do a much easier much more accessible here than they would be in north carolina so it i feel like i'm unable to upper sue heel of my passions ambitions in a much more functional unrealistic way living los angeles than i am in north carolina. i mean the cost of living is in great but soon come to i always tell people like part of the rent is having access to so much research so many resources out here so it's not even expensive is new york or boston so i thought the worst but i also don't mean is a little bit annoying that every time i do want to go home and safe lighting on the drive i can but mean really conceivably drive home for the holidays it's been 3 or 4 days and chair and just not practical so it's unfortunate so far away in that respect but geography. i studied history and media studies and production. yes i work as a freelance writer and producer. in college i realized i was pretty good at it and i knew there's way to monetize that and i came out here and worked a little bit in the public sector and trying to understand those jobs that way and realize i could make more money have more control over my schedule in my life if i did it for you and so i've been doing it now for a little over a year now. great. i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot i do my love traveling guy try to go somewhere new for a good. of time about every 7-day months to try to make something so i was in barcelona just recently and i'm planning on going to either vietnam or even back to europe in a couple months up. awesome. show me about traveling. enjoy the break from routine i think that while it's nice to wake up and have a vague idea where your day is going after a few months you can get very much kind of caught at the menu pigeon hole is your thought process your expectations for today i love going to foreign country and just waking up and knowing that everything i do that day is going to be brand new and totally different than what i would be doing if i was in los angeles earp and my run retain so i declare that i love food so it's great to just eat a lot of food i love in the places where they were originally created. yeah sure i went to barcelona like i said a few months ago and that was mainly because i had a friend who was living there for 6-7 months and she kept asking to come out and i finally i was at the point work i've been working so much for months on end i felt like i deserved a break so i went there for two weeks and he has won the healthiest smartest things i've done in a while so i reminded me again how important this for me at least two out to travel it to get out of the world. i'm very outgoing i love talking to people and conversing even virtual people i lost you. relax i listen play music a lot i like to read like to go see movies a cook i cook a lot so i enjoy cooking my girlfriend and i are currently separated by distance so i haven't seen her in weeks and that can be very sad and obviously so i'll talk with her as much as i can but i'm a pretty simple taste. okay. yep i have lost her but i don't know if is a mix-up you have a direct response that's okay no problem. this is awkward isn't. i don't have much of a temper so very good i guess i don't really get angry easily or quickly and well when i do i'm usually aware of it enough that i can kind of formulate how i feel and why i'm doing that way and what i want to be done about it so so it's pretty pretty so pretty easy-going guy in that respect. nopon sage probably something petty over like misremembering when. something was done or i get the date on something or like a fact i wasn't even emotionally filled and it was just about yeah i think it's probably about like trying to figure out when exactly we went to san francisco and it was even argue as much as just the other person thinking the other person's message remembering self even reno small or big situations very difficult for me to actually feel and rage by guess in the classical sense of the word. okay. tell me about a situation that you wish you would. true think i'm not one one for regrets. how much recently did a project like a a film and the subject matter had a little to do with like an ex girlfriend of mine so when it came time to release it i made a point i can i don't want to send her directly so i want her to think that i was doing it to spite her face by did center brother just because he enjoys my working i said i want to see stuff and i may be that she might have could have misconstrued as being passive aggressive i don't know but but yeah i mean that so bad i thought about that i don't really regret as much as like maybe i could have just let everyone else who wasn't so sure about if i should do stumble upon as opposed to me dragging it to them so just my thoughts are. tell me about the hardest decision i've ever had to make hardest decision i've ever had to make. it was actually probably probably that was even hard decision with excel with that the same as score for the mission of us probably cuz i knew i had to break up with her after some stuff happened and is the focus i cared about her great deal but i'll send him to me it wasn't hard to rival the conclusion that i had to break up with her the same time to it was not the easiest thing to try to go through that process it's being on a roller coaster that you're very much aware of how terrible or frightening is going to be but you know you have to get on the roller coaster so that's probably a recent memory. just cabinets for reasons that i this person is probably not the best person for me so i said it was a it was i didn't have to i don't have to weigh too much too much data to figure it out it was pretty clear sign and have no regrets about doing it now i feel very strongly then about it i felt so i still feel very strongly that i made the right choice.. how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep i can beat it can be tough there will be i feel like it's either 5 if i've exhausted myself during the day between work and the i buy started exercise has a huge help but but i'd say that it's kind of when i get to bed and i never know how it's going to go sometimes it's sometimes i wake up within an hour of falling asleep and can't go back to sleep or asia periodically keep getting up it up so it's something that's gotten a little better in the last few weeks but i am especially having my my current girlfriend not around because she's a very big source of comfort i also like that but she travels a lot for work so it's something to have to adjust to and asleep can be consumed as a person that but i'm respecting that someone actually i feel like i don't eat too much sleep i if i can get find get four to six hours in pretty good shape that day so. how have you been feeling. anxious i guess more just dance just whenever i get off of the assignment there's always just a question like what am i what's going on necks and if i don't have the next project lined up so it's always that nervousness some in the past something usually does come up so we have the president of it usual working up until it dies you always a little anxious and depressed because it's like a you know i chose not very much a lifestyle that while i get that a lot of control and economy over my life it also is all on me in or do it again with sometimes i buy i'm a very jealous of that if you'll just waking up going to the office for 8 hours leaving and not having to think about that work the minute they leave the office and kind of having the momentum of a group of people are our company carry them through when it's a little tough the words like me if i have an off-day if i'm a sick day that no work gets stuck on you know i'm a small business that has one employee. how do you cook. how do i cope with them i assume you mean i guess you could work without i cope with the may the better answer be how do i cope with that lifestyle just i got a much more he's doing something i'm still learning and figure out how to how to handle as far as not just like i know what the other how rewarding work is when i do it with all sophia what's the most efficient way to live the life you know how do i what's the appropriate way to budget finances what's the expectation i should have for myself in a given year wentz realistic what's helpful and that's something that i'm sure will take years and years to do but i feel like as long as i'm getting better at it then it's progress rent. have you been diagnosed with depression yes definitely will once and then probably out if i would have gone back i was gone in high school probably live in second time but i feel like it's one of those things that is something i have to keep in check throughout my entire life you know how i feel like i'm pretty happy person for the most part but has a as long as this bike is that what people are very creative or people do lots of the mind attends the fallen i get that to self esteem thing cuz it's so hard to feel so it was her so easy i supposed to get in your own head about that. this is within a year so i probably was feeling. awesome just haven't been there before i was kind of easy to figure out. you know it's going to happen again so i feeling the symptoms again. and going through those emotions and feel like okay at first i was kind of hoping to be some i could kind of working myself but i'm i realize or just stupid for me to try to fight the battle of my own so i went numb started seeing a therapist. really back this is my right just couldn't sleep at all i got to get maybe an hour of sleep at night at best on those sleeping at all had just no no no drive to do anything weather symbols brush my teeth or clean my apartment things like that and just being in the same time simultaneously being aware that's like oh this is all in my head inside even look at some of them so the general just a general malaise that comes with depression. i know i just finished up finished up i mean since i didn't graduate and like that but i got to a point where i felt like i kind of talked through as much as i could talk through and i moved on and another place my life is in a can of a good good work going to cash checks that i was working on something i really cared about now with someone i care about greatly and there's such a potential opportunity for me to do i have to worry about the symptoms and stuff as much now that i feel like therapy was not necessary also i just don't have the time to do with as much as work goes on some. oh i definitely i think having someone you can confide in who isn't your friend or family member who won't you know i have a few drinks and tell someone what you said to come early like that is definitely something i can't imagine how anyone couldn't benefit from having that on someone of a routine basis. i don't know i'm i'm coming from believer that all those things like those things are connected haunt you are also there for a reason like that my sister died when i was about 12 years old and she was younger than me and watching my parents like seeing my father cry for the first time was a very. trust traumatic thing for me and it felt like i grew up a lot that day so it's at my house so difficult to see that and see how my parents had to deal with losing a child i don't want to forget those things got the bitter berry interval to how i cope with life and how i perceive hardships and obstacles and haven't got image of knowing my father on it's very very humanizing so easy to kind of. you idolize your pants on so i like my father but you know he's he's a guy like me and as i get older and some easily identify with the man he is. syberia 16 or 6. i kind of like the notion that there is a you wouldn't worry as much what people thought about you to realize how people how much people didn't think about you it's really hard to tell a 16 year old and i'm at the point of telling a six-year-old but i'm p i feel like a specially when you're high school until i get to nowadays you live in los angeles where so much is caught up in how people think about you and i still am very i find out someone is upset with me or doesn't like me a father's me to a great dealer i hate letting people down so i would like to come to help your place or just knowing this and i'm just can't really control how people feel about you even if you have the best intentions in the world so. very compassionate guy on there for my friends i'm pretty selfless in that respect i have a good humor about things we even with people with being depressed or depression i can joke about it something you know i'm not a morbid to press mortise theo i'm aware of when i'm i'm low and i treated as such and i don't know i don't try to deny it or try to like and that's why i i have a i'm a pretty practical person in that respect i don't think i even i'm depressed i'll take it out on people or i don't think people feel told me they don't seem to mention that i've been going through a depression know what you said and i for one feel like when i do go through so i don't have one can just tell and i'm just a smoking gun of sadness basically but you know i stand to carry it pretty well enough i don't i don't lose sight of the reality of what i know is happening so. i was on my my girlfriend came she was in thailand for 3 weeks and then she supposed to go to spain for two but you can't sweat trip and came back and stay with me for about ten days and yeah i know i love her she's great she's the coolest person i know and so much fun and she when she's around makes me so happy and so having her for 10 days and we just had like normal we very rarely get normal couples time like it's always like oh i see for 5 days and then one of us has to go somewhere so they have 10 days is normal or we could just cook dinner at home like line bed and read books are like that was great. it makes me so happy that i have someone that i can do it within just feels so practical and feel so right. how your best friend describe you. you're so stressed about my mama i'm a good guy like guy but i know i don't know i don't think i screw people over i don't i'm a good friend to have i'm i'm there for people i look out for people i care about people and what they think of me and that goes especially much for my friends and i try to make sure you know it with a lot of my friends being on the east coast i try to carve out time to make sure they know i think about them and i called him and so i feel like i feel like people who count me as their friend them probably one of the better ones since the sense that i i know how much i appreciate and respect the friendships we have. thanks ali. strapped up.,0,0,2,0.8099529,0.1900471,,,,,373

8,34,"okay. yes. i'm doing pretty good. i was born and raised right here in los angeles. the weather would be number one i also like the diverse cultures i like the fact that there's a lot of different things here you can do and it's a lot of opportunity here not just for myself but for my kids and i think it's really a great place to be when you're trying to establish a career go to school learn about different people. the traffic the cost-of-living sometimes i think it's too big and that thinks the transportation system as far as the bus and train is long overdue they need to revamp it or you know add more buses and things like that just make it easier for people to get around on public transportation. i travel when i can a little bit here and there i have not been overseas yet which is a goal of mine within the next couple of years so i've just travel domestically i try to take at least one trip a year somewhere. i just like the fact of getting on the plane and going places i'm going to take me somewhere i've never been and learning about that place you know like so if i'm going to dc i really look forward to it cuz it's the historic city you know things like that. my most recent trip would have been dc his last year i went to go visit a friend and i stayed about i think three to four days and they got to see the capital he showed me around showed me all the you know historic landmarks and sites the white house the capitol building i got to see a lot of other different government building and it was it was a good experience the irony was i had to fly on 9/11 and so that had me a little and easy but once i was in the plane up in the air i was okay and it was all good and once i was back home i was like yes but i i just the trip and i look forward to going back. attending my friend's wedding she had a destination wedding in hawaii actually maui that was actually 233 years ago 3 years ago and all i guess and i've been trying to get back ever since and i want to take my kids and i just love it there and actually come look forward to two moving there one day. i have three sons 13 year old twins boys and my youngest is also a boy he's eight they all have birthdays in june the twins are june 9th and my baby is june 4th and so they just a few days apart but five years apart technically and they're just super super typical boys active all over plays hormones puberty is actually an interesting time because you know the two older boys going through puberty their teenage years still trying to figure some things out for himself you know doing that transition stage of 8 to 9 years old so he'll be 9 in june and then my oldest if you 14 so it's a challenging time for me as well. just the joy of watching what you put into being a parent everyday and seeing how just with love and nurturing and the right and you know when i can take proper development but just with you know love and nurturing how a baby grows into a toddler into you know a young boy to a teenager and an italian man is so that experience alone has been rewarding just watching my sons grow up and go through these different stages and see how they have developed and you know seeing some of the things that they are going through now that's so reminiscent of my teenage years and it's just it's very rewarding in and actually i look forward to maybe even being a foster parent later down the line when they're older and often college cuz i really love children giving back. probably a couple of things but i was just say. for me being a single parent is the financial well i would say that along with some of the emotional with them having to bear the brunt of the responsibility of just child child rearing you know the just the everyday things so what you have to deal with sometimes when you just tired you don't want to be bothered or you're trying to do things for yourself you have to be reminded that okay i got to cook or had to go pick my son up for i had to take him to baseball practice this one wants to go for hear this one is acting moody and you know just those those types of challenges that's what was the financial and you know making sure you know you're able to put food on the table you're paying your rent and you know you keeping up with the day today and that's those two are probably the hardest things for me to deal with. well i just take it day by day. i just put one foot in front of the other and i'm extremely spiritual so i just rely on god and pray a lot and meditate if i see a need a little help if you know i'm not above asking for help sell sometimes if i have to reach out to people or you know see what other resources are out there to help me you don't try to do that and so for me right now my biggest challenge is just trying to go back to school to put myself in a better economic situation so i can continue to provide for them comfortably. i studied communications actually i was a journalism public relations major with a minor in sociology and now i'm studying business. i just thought that you know. there would be more opportunities for me with business as far as jobs and then i you don't have a desire to go to graduate school so i just figured in the long run it was a better it will put me in a better position give me more opportunities with the communication just a little limited and especially as you get older the fields of tv report and things like that are kind of become you know harder to obtain so i just thought it i would going to something more realistic and you know but i like both fields are really do i like communicating riding reading talking as you can tell and sell the sea. a couple probably but i would say ultimately would be traveling like working as like a travel writer going to different destinations trying different foods out writing about different people cultures learning in living you know about those different people and culture living amongst the you know that the people there and being interacted with the children and stuff like that so i kind of hope to be able to do that one day but yes it would be something along those lines and then the fall back will be the counselor and social worker something in that area if i could encompass all three hopefully i can that i would like to do that. that's a hard question probably because i initially grew up very shy in the not so much shy as i am reserved now but not concerta but just reserved in you know what i go somewhere i'm checking everything everybody else out and then once i become comfortable or activates his situation and i'm like okay you know i warm up to the to the situation of the people but i'm also friendly i can be very friendly and outgoing you like to talk you know i seem like a chatterbox but i'm not really so usually if i'm in a big space with the whole lot of people i don't like to be the center of attention i can attach myself to one or two people and you know become friendly with them but i overall i am open friendly person. for me i could be something as simple as just unplugging everything all electronics and just sitting for a few moments meditating praying or reading a good spiritual scripture if i'm able to i like to go for a good massage maybe get a facial. you know things that will i, like the physical part part of a like massages things that really release tension and if not then like i said just sitting at home reading and praying or i like the beach i love the beach so sometimes that driving go sit by the beach i'll also like to just maybe go and have lunch by myself at our get a mani pedi or maybe go window shopping you know things like that. pretty good sometimes i'm just like i don't really have such an issue with the temper as i am i just a more impatient unfortunately a lot of times with people you know situations so i just can become really irritated or irritable quite agitated especially if it's that time of the month for me and just lose patience outside of that i'm actually pretty good i try to be very you know conscious of where i'm at and be very patient with people especially if i can see that the person is like if there's a new checkout person at the counter or cashier i do try to be i do try to be patient and understanding cuz i would want that you know if it were me i would want someone to explain that to me. you know what my kids sometimes you know it's just a works both ways to lymphocyte time of the month i'm just i guess just leave me alone or i might have a short temper or short fuse so i am conscious of it i try to be aware of it and then try to monitor it but you know like anybody i'm human and there are times where i have my days are moments when i catches like i go off and just lose it. well i haven't really had not presenting an argument but there's been an ongoing thing with american express so i would say. because it was not a personal contact with a company it really was an argument but i do know that i had some issues with american express had to call in a bottle and i think saturday and i'll tell i wasn't getting the response i expected inside look at the whole contact the call was just back and forth very frustrating and i was upset and you know the rap was trying over talk me you did i was trying to talk her so you know i don't know if you would consider that an argument but i would definitely say that's the last time when you know i just like reached my boiling point to say the least and was really upset and that i was the closest you know to an argument and then had to call back this morning that would be really up to delete an argument but it was a tense exchange for a minute or two. probably the most recent contact and that would have been the one on saturday with american express actually was on sunday yeah and i know the person trying to help me but you know when you're constantly being told different things and i've had to call in about five or six times about the same situation and it not be resolved it just takes you there so. just are kept raising my boys said some things i shouldn't have. and just was more so allowed myself to lose control of the contact i like to really feel in control of the contact and so it just took me there my blood pressure was raised. excuse me and that was just a kind of a mess for a while feel like maybe 30 minutes or an hour after that just irritable and agitated and upset and as far as always try to you know go back and pull from those and you know do my own sense of feedback and see how i can handle things differently but that's when i definitely wish i could have kept my cool and been more level-headed and and not really raise my voice and you know been more polite. what have probably have had a couple but police demos is a situation years ago when i just had my sons and they probably by twin there probably about 2 and i was in a situation with their father again and became pregnant and it just was not a good time and he pretty much scheudle was not comfortable with me having another child at the time and i wasn't comfortable with having another child either but wanted to keep the baby but you put me under so much stress and you know kind of thing i want to say really push me into having terminating the pregnancy and that's always stays with me and i've always missed that pregnancy that child i think about that that baby or what could have been i try not to hold any anger or resentment towards him or anybody. but it but i know deep down inside secretly if i had it to do all over again i would have just i would have kept the baby and move forward so that would have been probably the hardest especially emotionally like a deal with a lot and i have dealt with a lot you know being unemployed or you know a lot of financial problems but that to me was the heart. thank you. no. ok google. i was laid off in december so i've been constantly trying to do things to you know get back on my feet so that's been a little tough and i had to face a lot of challenges and dealing with that and issues with child support and trying to find another job and going back to school so i'm at my range of emotions have just have been just that arranged at a very good friend of mine now who we both started off. you're on the same place about five years ago well she's been able to move forward and going with her lies and now she's graduating in next month from usc with her masters in social work so i'm feeling a little envious of that and i have been for like the past year but more so recently although i'm very very happy for her you know and she's a good person and she deserves it back of course you don't got it when she was me so that she was kind of been bothering me. well i'm really good with them people i communicate well i like to talk really good with children that's why i would like to teach her be a counselor. although i haven't got really tapped into it i know i'm a very creative person i know i write pretty good i could possibly be a creative writer but i know very creative soul is given the opportunity i know i could tap into that and really develop those skills something like with maybe song writing fiction writing but probably like interior decorating anything artistic just anything cuz i love musical of arts i love drama love plays. lubbock fashion buff but i do love fashion and makeup and stuff like that so i think those words are are my strong points as well as just getting along with people i know it would make a great counselor people my friends come to me all the time i have a good ear for listening i'm a great mediator and i know how to because i've been through a lot and one of my friends call me the voice of reason the one that's actually graduate from sc but i know i'm like light years ahead of a lot of people when it comes to insight and wisdom and i don't know what to do if you don't have an older parents myself or how i grew up or i have had very traditional so i can parents who is still a lot of great value thin me or if it has anything to do with my astrological sign i'm a pisces but i'm really good with people just so you know. you know like i said i have my moments but i know if it's if it's something. i could go into a developed i would do well. really some of the situations or wish i would have waited to maybe have gotten married before i had children pick a different partner. and i say that mean my son's father is great but a great father for my kids and i was too much as a partner for me we're not together we have been together in years but i'm just saying over ross had i yeah i think i would say if i could let me backtrack that say not finishing school when i should have in my phone right my dreams and goals and doing things that's like animals planning initially and i think that's that would i honestly be the one thing i could say i regret is not following my goals and i'm finishing school on time and episode when i really want to do. stay focus and finish school and pick a career path and stay on that and stay motivated and don't let anything or anybody to tell you. i think i'm pretty stable and consistent just with overall thing come how i faced adversity house i face things you know i'm a pretty committed person i try to you know if i say i'm going to do something to try to stick to it i'm a very loyal friend and them are proud of the fact that i've maintained that a pretty good job of raising my kids so low. okay. great thank you bye bye. okay.",0,0,2,0.8484408,0.15155917,,,,,438
9,37,all right. okay thank you. and please. are you okay with. yes. i'm okay doing a little tired and worried. well i am looking for a place to live and i don't have a job right now so things are you sore a little. shaky for me. these days. where do you live i'm staying with my son in venice. it's pretty good but both of us need to have our own space so that's why i'm looking for another place to live. originally from new york but i've been in california since the early 70s. yeah. i moved to la because i had been living in portland oregon and i was getting tired of the weather up there and my son was down here so it seems like a good place to be. how easy was it for you to get used to living in la. and it wasn't too hard i i met people right away and i just really liked it here so it was it was easy to connect with people. the weather is number one for most people i love being near the ocean i like the energy i like if they are like the artistic culture. well everybody loves the traffic and me loves the weather and hates the traffic so i kind of feel i feel the same way sometimes it gets a little wearing that it's so busy and the fact that it's so expensive makes it difficult. i see what you mean. i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer. you travel a lot. i know not as much as i'd like if if i had more and more income more friends i would travel more. i mostly have been. may i travel as let's say so my longest trips it was out of the country was to mexico and i traveled drove down with a friend down to oaxaca and the whole trip we took about about 4 weeks going down and back from the bay area. yeah that was a fun trip. well we've been working together on the census and if she had made that trip a few times and invited me to come along with her. from that trip i would say we were in oaxaca for a day of the dead so it was celebrating day of the dead with the family in the little village that we were staying in at everybody in the village makes an altar in their house for their loved ones who have passed away and. they also decorate clean and decorate the graves so there were lots of flowers and it was just it was neat to be there and be with that family celebrating that. i studied i was in the liberal arts program but i didn't stay stay only stay in school for in college for a couple of years but i was most interested in liberal arts and humanities. dream job. my dream job would be personal assisting somebody who was in a creative field and getting to travel and go to events with them. how hot is it. it's hard to break into i'm starting now very minimally with somebody who i'm doing more of a volunteer work with and i'm i'm working on building up some of my skills so that i can be doing more of that. i'm fairly i'm kind of a friendly introvert so you know i have no trouble meeting people i don't hold back and you know i just am not like shy at parties i'll go up and talk to people but i am over all kind of introverted so. i prefer one-on-one then big groups. i like to watch i like to watch improvement shows like hgtv i like to watch. i agree model shows and and see transformations or watch movies or read i play some solitaire on my my kindle fire. okay. how are you at controlling your temper. i don't usually realize i'm mad until later it doesn't really come up and i just tend not to have the kind of life where. those situations arise us sometime soon of sometimes on the road i get a little annoyed i don't get annoyed so much i like when people cut me off or anything like that but when people are deliberately rude and and you know honk for no reason or. you know it when they get angry because maybe i've done something inadvertent nail cut them off by mistake and you know like they get really angry then that makes me angry and return. when was the last time you argue with. yeah i like i said i don't really get into arguments. i did have i was with a friend the other day and. she got annoyed with me because she felt like i was correcting her. so it wasn't really an argument but she. i had said something that she heard as a correction while it was a correction and she got angry. well then i felt criticized and i felt i felt vulnerable i wasn't it was it was pretty uncomfortable. well in that situation i didn't i didn't have to correct her. so. i think that's something i'm starting to look at in myself is my need to be right. so in general that's i'm trying to to catch that and just let people. make mistakes with without my telling them about it. i don't know. that's tuff. i can't know that i've had that much trouble making decisions. well. hard for me to decide to put my cat to sleep when he was sick. oh it was and i had to give up a cat. and i was moving once and and that was difficult to. well in the case of the first cat the one that was sick. i decided when the vet said that he thought it was the humane decision. and with cat i had to give up i didn't i. didn't really decide i was moving to a place that where i couldn't take her. and so i thought i found somebody who could take her. say that stuff. i don't really have that the erasing from the memory part. there's nothing i really wish i could erase from my memory. trying to think of something that i've done that i. wish i hadn't done. oh okay i remember something they were there was a time when i was i was in a class at junior college it was a film class and i was i was the one who was after we we went out and did a little film project. and we're supposed to bring it back into class the next week i was the one who had the film and through different just things that were happening in my life right now and never went back to the school but i never brought them to film back so all the work they have done i had to do over again and i still feel bad about that. but it's pretty easy sometimes i wake up in the early morning hours and and have trouble going back to sleep but that's not very often. how to concealing lately. i've been feeling kind of tired and low-level depressed like not feeling a lot of options. no. yes i have. oh there were two times there was once back in like 1970. 290 about 1972 or 3 and then. another time. oh so then would that have been in bed 16 years ago. just feeling like there wasn't. you know feeling the feeling that things weren't going to change. if i didn't get some help and that if i. i didn't have to let you know that maybe if i got some medication that would help me. and the short-term. i'm not going to therapy right now. travis moving around alot finances there wasn't really feeling the need starting to think it might be an option again. i feel like therapy can be useful. well when i went to therapy. it was helpful to have somebody who listened and could also. offer impartial suggestions for helping me to improve the way i was feeling. i was on the beach last weekend was beautiful day and i was sitting in the sun and just relaxing i had my notebook can i was doing some writing and i felt very happy and content. i'm kind and compassionate and i'm a good listener. and i'm intelligent and i have five good ideas. well i wish that. sometimes i wish i was a harder worker i'm not really willing to take. low-wage jobs even though. i need work so i just don't feel like i'm willing to do anything. and. i wish i could act as i said i had good ideas i have good ideas and i'm good at the the onset but i'm not really good on the follow-through so a lot of those ideas get started but then i don't take them the distance that's probably the the thing i'd like to change my myself the most. 10 or 20 years ago i'd give myself the advice to go back to school and get my degree. finish my education. and be willing to. to work a regular job and two. to start putting money away for my retirement. what are you most proud of in your life. proud of my children and i am proud of the friendships i have and i'm proud

break. a lot slower paced. more. i wanted you to pursue a film degree or i'm sorry i film career. are you still doing that yes. it's pretty challenging but it's fun. i've always had an interest in film and movie so it seemed like a natural fit for me. took about a couple of years. bachata. i feel like i'm pretty used to it now. i liked it doesn't snow it's warm weather and there's lots to do with a lot of beaches. show the traffic and the cost of living is pretty high. i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i got much of a. i never been outside of the us but i would love to at some point. you can see yourself more shy. depends on the situation i can either be introverted or extroverted just given the right circumstance. okay. sometimes when i'm feeling. i turn on the fish tank screensaver. i know it's not polite but it's the best i've got. what are you doing. i like listening to music doing crossword puzzles reading and hanging out with friends on weekends. very good. i don't think it was an argument maybe about difference of opinion so is more like a debate but it was pretty pretty tame. i think it was a debate over sports of a basketball game. and i was talking on facebook with somebody about it. but i think it's good to express yourself if you have a difference of opinion it's it's natural to you know not always agree on things so i think talking about it is healthy. i have a very good relationship with my family i get along with all of my family members and extended no cousins and aunts and uncles so there's no one that i have ever had any risks with. with my family. i probably could have been more disciplined growing up and more. more disciplined with schoolwork and homework that kind of thing. but for the most part i had a i had a good childhood and there's not much i would change about it. okay. tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had. probably leaving my comfort zone and south carolina moving out here that was pretty hard but at the same time it was exciting so it was it was a bittersweet feeling. a lot of excitement mixed with some anxiety but it went away pretty quickly. sure. okay. what's something you feel guilty about. not doing better in school when i was in high school. you've done anything to avoid it. i definitely i could have been more diligent worker i could have applied myself a little bit better. i've always had a strong family support system. and our parents and siblings so. that's definitely a positive thing. tell me about new bed or. event. probably going back to school i wish i would have. wish i would have done better in school so i could take something back from my past it would be scholastically related. how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep. it's pretty easy. i don't sleep well. i tend to be kind of lackadaisical and just tired throughout the day kind of groggy. okay. have you noticed any changes in your butt. i know everything's pretty much the way it usually is with me. how did the feeling lately i'm feeling pretty good. i know i have not. i know i haven't. first time i felt really happy. i made a lot of money a few weeks ago and i feel like i'm ahead of the game with you know what having rent under control and a lot of bills out here so i'm still kind of have the lingering effects for not happiness. yeah. when i. when i have money i tend to be a lot more even-tempered not even tempered but i tend to feel better about things and more optimistic and the city being such a about your finances if it always makes you feel good to be ahead of the game and to have. dish have sources of income. i think i'm creative. and i think i'm a good listener. to be as disciplined and focused as possible. because once you're out of your parents homes and out of their lives you have to depend on yourself in the better the better you do in school in the better you are. as far as discipline concerned the more pleasure pleasurable your life will be in a lot your life will be a lot easier. let's see here. i wish i was more. disciplined but i'm working on that and i've gotten a lot better at that. it's become pretty easy i think i'm just getting older i'm i'm out of my twenties now so i definitely seeing a change from when i first came out here. tell me about. some people tend to say that my decision to move out here was not feasible and kind of a pipe dream so that kind of made me feel bad but i kind of take insults and stride and sometimes that welcome constructive criticism because something is wrong with either you're not aware of so as long as it's not mean-spirited it's coming from the right place i think it could be an invaluable tool you listening to what other people have to say that might be negative. probably optimistic and. outgoing optimistic and. helpful. find your ideal week. my ideal weekend i would love to go to vegas and have a road trip with what three or four friends in a packed in the car and just lots of disposable income and you know good weather. when is the last time that happened. i haven't been to vegas and probably 5 years but. i've gone to casinos with my brother and it's pretty fun sometimes. i'm proud that i've come a long way from when i first moved out here i'm a lot more disciplined i read a lot i do crosswords and i think i've. i think i know it's important life now and i'm more focused and going after what i want. i'm not a big fan of high taxes. but it doesn't really make me mad it makes me frustrated and and. i guess i take it in stride though. i had a friend over at my apartment and i watch the movie now

16,75,yes. okay. i'm santiago chile. permanently in 1977. about every three to four years. it's similar. my parents moved here. very easy. the variety the culture. the things there so many things to do. so many options. traffic. the pressure to live up to a high standard. expensive. i'm sociology and psychology. i. i got a job in the social service field and i didn't have an education and i felt that with an education i would be much better equipped to provide services for the population i was working with. yes. no. to own my own nonprofit organization that provides services for women that are considered marginalized populations. i like to travel but no i don't travel a lot. oh the different cultures the different architects the. the knowledge that you acquire. variety of foods. okay. i can tell you that one of my favorite places is sedona arizona because it's so beautiful and so clean and open. neither i can be i can be really shy but i force myself to be more outgoing. though i think people perceive me is very outgoing. i go on facebook. or i check my emails or i watch movies. comsi comsa. sometimes i'm really good for the most part but there are times when i'm feeling very stressed and i have temper outbursts of anger outbursts. i don't know about. maybe. 30 days. ago. and it was about my inadequate parenting skills. ashamed. angry confused. but i also felt like i needed to have my perspective understood. i have four kids. three boys and one girl. my oldest son is a living in mar vista and he's doing some menial job. he's creative and artistic and has a really good heart my third son is my second son cuz he's my third child lives in alabama he has a daughter and he also has a menial job. i bet he moved there to be with his daughter he's not together with his daughter's mother. and. he's funny and really smart and. wickedly clever. and my third son my youngest is living in los angeles is living on his own. working in a menial job is kind of finding himself he's extremely kind and sensitive and caring and loving but he tends to be a pretty hard on himself. and has a lot of opinions about a lot of things. i love being a parent but being a parent isn't easy. the unconditional love you feel for your children. tolerating their shortcomings and their suffering. and feeling like. regret for not having done a better job. i think i tell my children that i love them and that i'm proud of them and that. i have a much more open communication and a more accepting of the choices that they make even though i might not agree with him. close to my sister's i'm pretty distant for my mother. i was closed when i was younger than my father but he passed away when i was 25. my college professors. i think that they. help me perceive a different perspective on human beings made me more altruistic and more. open and less judgement judgemental. being poor. and unsuccessful. i think i could have made. better choices regarding the. fathers of my children and or stepfather's. maybe. when i. i left my kids. my first marriage. i am. i was really immature and a knowledgeable and felt that i couldn't provide for my children so i made a choice to leave them with her father for a. of time and that was a regret and then when i was 36 i was diagnosed with cancer and. i had to make the choice of again leaving my kids with their perspective fathers. and. until i got better i wasn't able to be a full-time mother. yeah it was. separation for my kids is really hard separation for my kids is really hard. i feel. a shame and guilt and remorse. because had i had a more stable. financial. financial and emotional and psychological foundation i might have had the ability to not have caused them some of the problems that they have today. sometimes good i have to be really tired sometimes not so good. ineffective. ineffective. i think i'm making more of a conscientious effort to get organized and take some. steps to physical health well-being. getting out more forcing myself to participate in life more. no. yes. i'm originally i think i was diagnosed in 1980. maybe before that but it was never a formal diagnosis. i tried to commit suicide. yes. sometimes. i am no longer. truly suicidal. i don't know. 2006/2007. went to the beach for a walk with my dog. i have a great ability to empathize i am open to learning i crave learning i'm socially empathetic. i love my children. i'm a good friend. will my depression is one thing. i wish i was more intelligent that school was easier for me. i wish i didn't have such low self-esteem. i wish i could be more motivated in participating in areas that i'm interested in. yeah. go to college. play children. goodbye.,0,0,2,0.82392275,0.17607723,,,,,435
17,77,"when she's done. hi i'm ali thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people and it's safe. and please. are you okay. yeah. i'm doing pretty okay thanks for asking how are you. i'm from here in la i grew up in the san fernando valley. yeah. well i like the the diversity of people the different kinds of food you can eat i like the outdoor opportunities i grew up close to the hills so i did a lot of hiking and camping is pretty close by have gone snowboarding i like it the familiarity i think you know it's it's a big city and you know i'm pretty familiar with the having lived here for so long that i haven't said like that too. i'm probably the number one thing that everybody says i don't like gothic that don't like being stuck in traffic i don't like. the long commute stephen nina for short distances. danonino gets really hot in the summer a time so you know that i could stand it being a little slightly cooler when i gets to its peak peak heat but that's fine. well my dream job that's a great question i asked. i think my dream job would probably be you know maybe being able to travel and somehow make money off of that profit off it you know maybe gainful employment office traveling but it's almost an unrealistic dream since i don't know if i would actually want to do that but if. if i had to pick some kind of dream existence he of traveling getting paid to travel and meeting new people trying new things and being able to make a living out of that would be pretty fun. well i like like a mention what i like by the way i like trying different kinds of food different cuisine so i think trying authentic cuisines in different places and meeting different kinds of people sing different ways of life would be that is what i like about traveling i like experiencing new things i think that'd be nice so you know despite the fact i said i'd like the familiarity of la there's also funded discovering you think so i think when i travel that's that's what i like to do just checking things out. i would like to be you know if i could make a living doing that that be great. one of my trips okay well let's see the the last trip i took. i think of what one one more exciting trip. well my my family is from eastern europe so one of the trips i took with my parents when i was fourteen was i went to austria hungary and romania and you know getting to see some of those old guy been a few times before but i was when i was little so i don't really have too much primary plus i didn't really process things quite the same as when i was kind of more of age so i got to see you know my family is old you know hometown you know that we have a family like tomb so i got to see that than just these old buildings and just a different way of life i really like that you know seeing my parents old friends you know and so that was pretty funny was very different i was like really my first time being taken away from my my home environment do you know i left them know the school year so is just like going from no suburban america to traveling around kind of you know taking these old trains and sandy's castles and he's old like hundreds of the year old townsend. i don't know if it was for everyone you know i don't know it would be great for everybody by i really enjoyed it. but it's the best. oh that's that's a good question i do i probably one of the things i do is either turn on like a rerun of a sitcom i used to watch the office a lot so i kind of know when that's on so i'll turn that on you know just kind of zone out a little bit too you know if you like it characters in and hearing the jokes that are still funny for some reason or maybe like eating some kind of comfort food you know i try not to eat too much fast food at all but like in and out i really like going there so if i have to unwind once every few months maybe i'll do that or i really like to read especially like i'll read the day's events you know that that really relax with me for some reason even if it's reading about something some conflict going on some of the world ii soul i'll read the headlines and i really like to know what's going on that kind of centers me so i really enjoy that that's the way i do to relax. i would say i'm pretty great at it at all though i don't i think my nature makes it pretty easy pranks that pretty easy i don't i don't get very upset easily at all so it's not much of a challenge to control my temper at. yeah i don't really have anger issues that it's difficult for me to get angry so i don't i don't i don't really have much trouble with that at all. last time i argued with somebody was probably. i don't even know i a mean small disagreement see no i might have had with family or friends about things but just a full-on argument i got i can't even remember it's been years i did i don't really argue too much i try to avoid conflict as much as possible in my in my personal life i don't really see anything to be gained by and i kind of naturally repel away from it so i don't have much to say about arguing. what's something you feel guilty about. i feel guilty about i would say that you know something sometimes i don't really. i feel like i may be having made the most of my potential yet in life i think that i could definitely do more despite the fact i work a lot i feel like i there's always more opportunity out there that they were missing i feel like you know sometimes down time i feel a little bit guilty about that because there's always something that i could be doing that i'm not even if it's just putting away the laundry that that's been i took out of the dryer that's been sitting there or. running late i really don't like running late although it happens more than i'd like to write i don't know why i feel guilty about that i don't like keeping people wait waiting because it makes it feel like you're my time is not more valuable than theirs which is obviously not true. tell me about new bed or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. nothing immediately comes to mind i well the last car accident i got into it was a few years ago i guess i wish it hadn't happened. i wish i could erase it from my memory but i ate was driving in rush-hour traffic and you know it i thought the cars in front of me where we're going you know at least for a little mia 10-15 feet but it turns out that that stops so you know slow rear end collision but it was still very important i was just you know i just felt like i was paying attention one second and the next second you know i was just like reaching for something on the lights in the passenger seat and then i ate i smacked into the car in front of me in. i wish i had a theft and absolutely i know it's a minor thing but it was just really unfortunate the timing of it was very bad enough for me financially any of the people i got into an accident while we were fine but i was you know they they didn't ask for anything beyond repairing the damage is but that it was just a horrible timing so i wished i hadn't happened. but that sucks it did suck i've over now but i suck. okay. how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep well i'm a pretty good sleeper although i naturally wired to be up later at night so unfortunately my unfortunately my job allows me fortunate pretty flexible schedule but on the same token i wish i could wear like hardwired to go to sleep earlier because i just i wind up staying up till 1 or 2 every night and it's just too late you know even though i can get a full eight hours or whatnot of sleep it's not always at night time you know half of my sleep is like in the head of early daylight hours i wish i were more able to sleep. go to sleep at like 10 or 11 and then sleep in or wake up earlier as opposed to. going to sleep later and waking up later. i'm pretty feeling pretty good. i've been i have no complaints physically and you health-wise i feel good you're my relationships with my my family and friends are good. everything is great so far i had absolutely no no real complaints as far as how i'm feeling. myself or anything like that. no no i've been fairly consistent with my behavior in my thoughts i think that. everything is been been pretty okay pretty said he no no nothing traumatic nothing kind of resurfacing for the past nothing of the sort has this happened there is happening. no. no. well i think there's plenty of things everybody regrets yeah yeah there's there's plenty of things. in my life yeah like i said i i do regret you know maybe not trying harder in my younger days he know i there's a pretty of time in my early twenties where i i didn't work for a while i just i hung out with a lot of friends yeah i guess it was like the proverbial bad crowd you know none of us work we just you know we we got high everyday or it seemed like every day i don't know it was just this is kind of like a throwaway. of my life. advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago. i would say that. it's important to. 210 gauge with the world i think i i think i kind of dropped off in the world a little bit i think it's also i would say that it's important to. recognize the people around you for what they are you know and what what kind of potential do you know if you try tivities that you can expect from the people you surround yourself with i think that i would say also that kind of try to focus on what i wanted to do with my life as opposed to just thinking while you know things will work out which eventually they do but i think that you know there's a bit of lost time with that approach is kind of fatalistic and i think that i would say you know just try to concentrate you know you know not not everyone works on the same schedule in life is not a race but i would say that it was it important to have a goal in mind or some kind of you no idea for what what you want out of life as opposed to just kind of waiting and thinking of things will fall into place. tell me about a time when someone made you. well i i. i guess some people i i don't especially. take it even constructive criticism particularly well for some reason i think that at least myself i sort of have things figured out although i am not sure i'm wrong about that so i think just maybe in terms of like a group work. done professionally or academically you know when when some of my work is kind of picked apart or were scrutinized i'd i don't deal well with that and i had taken more personally than i should. show me about a year-and-a-half ago i was working on a research project at work and somebody with much less those three of us working on something and then they brought in another pair of eyes just to go over it in those somebody just out of god college you know. went over what we have done and you know it's just kind of rewording things and it seems just like cosmetic changes that were being made just for the sake of of changing things and i kind of took first offense to that just because i thought i had a lot more experience and more education and it was unnecessary that you know i thought the whole thing was a waste of time and you know i just. i didn't think that she was somebody that was qualified to attend this earlier we do all our work or or even to not not to redo it but to 2 edited or to proofread i guessed it to make any kind of you know qualitative changes i i just thought that it was a really bad idea and i thought that you know i should have viewed it this way but i thought that the fact that they brought in somebody with almost no experience you know it was kind of like an affront to us would work on it on this project but you know it wasn't our call. most memorable experiences. i guess the first thing that comes to mind is one of my the first real trip i took by myself i took the the amtrak to to new mexico and i was out there exploring things for about 10 days on my own so that was kind of the longest. time up till that point and i was in my 23 maybe at the time that i had really just been on my own completely cut off from everyone i was in parts of new mexico where there's no cell phone reception at the time. it is very memorable because i was on it on my own i feel like i was really you know exposed to the things i wouldn't have seen if i had to had traveling companions it was a lot of fun. tell me about the last time you felt. i live a very happy recently i didn't for that i'm getting married in a few months i got engaged on labor day 2012 this whole process casino album a meeting some of them we'd be kind of progressed very quickly realize where we would recognize her we were so i've been a pretty happy state the past it's been 11 months now but yeah so i think that the day we got engaged and then we we shared it with our family i think those have been very happy times new years was happy you know happy. of my life right now so. yeah thank you. what sort of. sets of humor that maybe not everybody gets i'd say also. you know helpful, i'm relaxed maybe. intelligent you know likes to recycle i know that's so suck that they would say. hey what else i think that best friend might say that i like animals i've always had dogs and cats so they might describe me as a people person i mean an animal person sees me i also you know fairly easygoing you know flexible with with plans. i'd say one of the most proud of in my life. well i'm pretty happy with the level of education i've gotten i'm also going back and starting the fall i'm starting a ph.d program so i'm happy about that happy about you know breaking so my bad habits from the past that i'd say if i'm proud of anything it's that you don't have a strong faith relationship i go to church off and i'm very happy about that i don't have pride is the right word but my relationship to my family and friends are all very good i'd say maybe the fact that it's a lot different than my life is a lot different than it was about 10 years ago you know that the change i'm i'm happy and proud of that. no problem have a good day thank you. goodbye.

18,78,so she's going to chat with you for a bit i'm actually before i do that. okay okay. hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today. created to talk to people in it safe. i'm not a thing. are you okay. sure. i'm doing alright. new jersey. yes. 3 months ago. not very often. how does it compare to la. that's much different. i don't know it's just it's a lot more crowded here. to start a new life for myself. it wasn't very easy at all. it was quite rough at first but you know i'm still trying to get used to a life here. i've got some good friends here and i love the hollywood area. i just did all of the mountains are beautiful kind of things i love. things you don't really. the traffic. not really know i don't. just haven't had the time or the finances to. okay. what you study. digital media. how did judas. well life always love you know computers and you know designing things and i know it's kind of fell into it. are you still doing that no. i dropped off. well i guess my dream job would be working in something that i went to school for a night and never really completed my education. but i guess it'd be great if i want you know back to school and you know it finished you know my degree in digital media and you know if finished started working you not doing something in that field. a little bit of both. i can be shy at times but. i like to push myself to be outgoing you know it's kind of a struggle for me but. i don't want to be you know in a shell so i can force myself to be outgoing. listen to music sometimes just drive and you know play music in my car and that helps me relax. or smoke a cigarette. like what. stucky middle that's all i listen to is metal. awesome. well it depends on. how high my stress level is and how angry i am. but i i do my best to not get so pissed off. when was the last time you are. and. i don't know if she. she wanted me to come and pick her up. she's a little drunk. and we just kind of fought over the phone over some other things and. i just ended up not picking her up. because of her attitude on the phone with me. yeah it does. something i feel guilty about not talking to my kids often. or as often as i should. i've just been so busy with trying to get myself all situated here that i i don't really have time to. you know talk to my kids as much as i'd like to. you have no idea. it's it comes natural but it's snowy easy and it's it's the hardest job that i love to do. but right now it's extremely difficult for me because they live so far away and i made the choice to come out here to la. and i feel bad that i don't see them you know. but. the reason i came out here was to better myself so i can provide for them. what's the hardest thing about being. fear you know. just fear what we need another if you're what's going to happen to your kids who fear. that something awful is going to happen. and not seeing them brings about that fear a lot more you know and i can't i can't always be there with them i can't see them you know it it wasn't as bad when i was living in florida. and i at least needs to see them it wasn't very often but i still used to see them now i don't see them at all and that's the that's the hardest thing i've had to do as a parent is to step away from my kids if only temporarily cuz i don't know how long we'll be here for. i don't know what my future holds. but the hardest thing is being so far away from them. i'm sorry. the best thing about being a parent. the joy that they bring to me i mean i could be having a bad day and they just cheer me right up. i mean. it sucks being away from them for for so long and they're so far away and just not seeing their faces that's. it's the worst thing ever you know but. i love to just see their faces if they just bring a smile to my face and. well. i think the fact that i can get down to their level goofy or as a father than my dad was with me my dad was you no strict all the time she refused to let you know laugh and play with us but you know he was always very reserved you know and he kind of held back like a lot of emotions just because you know he was a he was a strong very tough guy but with me i'm very goofy and silly like it that i'm strict when i have to be. but i always love to be no playing around with them as much as possible you know not i don't want them to grow up too fast. but that may have been. well. situation that i wished i would have handled differently. there's so many. i guess what i was still with my ex-wife. in florida i wish you wouldn't have gotten so angry or i wish i wouldn't have let her get the best of my emotions. she had a tendency to get underneath my skin and now you know keep picking at me until i exploded and i allowed her to do that. you know it i should have just walked away when i could. you know now that my temper get the best of me. no. no. no. how is your day. sometimes it's hard. sometimes i just lay awake in bed you know thinking all the things are going through my head all the you know all the stress that i'm going through with work and nino. making sure. i wonder if i'm going to i'm going to be able to make you know rent you know one day when my kids are going through you know when i'll see them again if they even care about me anymore if they even know they have a father. you know those are some things that went through my head and. and it keeps me up at night sometimes. a little but you know i put myself in the situation so. you know i got up. bear with it and i got to. i know that you reap what you sow so lights. i got to deal with it in my own way. have you noticed any changes in your butt. lately i've been trying to not think so much about. you know all that's going on in my life. i try to distract myself. the kind of. gets me in a better mood you know if i'm hang out with my friends or just watch a little tv something to get my mind off you know all the stresses of my life. the last time i felt really happy. was i see a couple of nights ago i went out drinking with them. with a couple of my friends from work and. i don't know we just got pretty drunk and that kind of help me to forget all the crap that was previously gone through my head. so if i can distract myself i can forget about all that other stuff. but i'm happy. some of my best qualities i guess i'm convincing kind of like a i guess you would say a counselor to some people only answer my close friends i made talk people into doing things that they may regret or i'm at i'm going to try to talk people out of things that they and i may end up regretting or i may. you know just listen to people so you know i can see that you know i definitely know with my friends and help them out in their time of need when they're going through something troubling times like what i'm going through. lips in florida. you know i talk to him every now and then and he's been having troubles with his girlfriend and. you know i just kind of. talking about his problems to listen to i merely listen because you know i don't think he has anybody else to listen to you know when i was living in florida i was very close with him so you know you can always rely on me and now that i'm here in la. i don't want to lose that you no connection with him because i mean i've always been there for himself. he him your lies on me to listen to his problems and give him some advice in about what i think you know he should do. i think he appreciates that night and i'm glad that he you never lies on me for that i that he trust me enough to tell me all that stuff. upgrade. what are some things you wish you could change about your. lol. sometimes i wish i wasn't so kind or just rest. it seems bad but sometimes i don't people may take advantage of me and i may not realize it. and i don't like saying no to people i like. to always please people. so if i can change them i wish i wasn't such a people pleaser. and that gotten you in trouble. sometimes financially in trouble. sometimes i get annoyed. help others in that you know. that made me broke sometimes i may not have enough to. pay bills but i feel better helping people i don't know. i regret. nut. breaking up with my ex-wife sooner. arie arie. because she put me through so much crap in my life. and i'm. i was wishing to be a people pleaser ocean to please her you know china. please my kids as much as i can but not breaking up you know the family. but. there's only so much one person can take. and i think probably if i would have left sooner. i'm even happier and things may not have gotten so out of control out of hand like they did you know. during all those years with her. so if i would have got out sooner. i don't know my whip been happier by guess. advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago. it's okay to be selfish. it's okay to you know. think about yourself sometimes. you know if you keep putting everyone ahead of you. then you're not thinking about yourself you're nothing about what makes you happy. even though pleasing people make you happy. you have to think about yourself sometimes too in about your needs. because you know. you play an important role. in the lives of your close family members. and in order to keep everything afloat. you sometimes get up you got to worry about the one person that's you know juggling everything and holding everything up witches yourself so. be a little selfish sometimes it's okay. right. tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. i don't even know what weekend is anymore. my ideal weekend would be. locked away alone in my room. watching movies listening to music just with my cell phone off and not going to be with anybody or could be out at a bar. you know you know watching a metal show. so i like to be alone. but at times i i do want to be out with that with others i like you know being around people. crazy. he thinks i'm a i'm crazy for coming out here. but i guess you would say that i'm dedicated and then i'm strong-minded. and that you know whatever i set my mind so i can do it you know no matter how hard it is i'm not going to wimp out. so every night i really respect him for giving me his insight. but i guess yeah i guess you'd say that. crazy butt. show my dick. my kids. yeah that's the one thing that brings joy to me you know her like real real joy are my kids and. you know just having on my life is promised me i could never help us just having thumb. in my life. and although i don't get to see them as much. you want to think about those thinking about you know. how far they've gone. you know what what they've accomplished in their you know. in the short time we did it yeah it makes me happy and i can't wait to see them again. one of my most memorable experiences. i guess that would be.

surveillance i did i did report writing i did undercover work i did all kinds of different things at one point so that would be my dream job. you consider yourself more shy or outgoing. right now i feel like i'm outgoing but generally i'm shy when it comes to the two social scenes lot of times i'm shy but right now i don't feel shy right now i feel comfortable talking to you. i was adopted so my relationship with my family. didn't really go that well so i'm really not close with my adopted family and i don't have limited biological family so i don't really have a lot of family but the the very few that i have i love them very much and i try to spend as much time with him as i can. what is the best. what do you do. i listen to music and i pray. i pray i listen to music and imma just meditate on positive things take a walk ride a bike read a book things like that. didn't used to be very good at it but throughout the years going through hard times and learning the hard way i've learned to control my temper pretty well now it takes a lot to get me to give me angry i'm more passive now than i ever have been and i i like that about myself. when was the last time. i argued with my best friend probably wasn't like a real serious argument but we argued a little bit about a religion which i don't like to go into a r i don't like 2 to get into arguments about but unfortunately we got into argument about religion she wanted me to she wants me to join her religion i don't feel like it's right what i should do and i so we got into a little dispute about that. better situation that. etsy. there's many many many situations that i wish i had it handled differently and one of them was my children i wish i could have been. i wish i could have been a better dad to my kids i wish i could have made better decisions for my children and i didn't. what's something you feel guilty about my guilt i feel guilty about that about not being a good parent to my kids at many times in my life and that guilt stays with me my whole life everyday i think about it. tell me about. let's see the hardest dishes decision i've ever had to make. i wish i could erase from my memory. the last time that. having. getting divorced would be one of the last things with the memory of that relationship going bad was probably one of the things of the last excuse me one of the things i'd like to erase from my memory. the last time i interacted with my ex-wife. yeah i was in the navy. how old are you. i was 18. just a kid. well to be honest with you i was 18 years old and i didn't have anywhere else to go i was homeless and it was either be homeless on the street at 18 or join the military and try to do something with my life and so that's what i chose to do. are you happy you did. yeah. in a way out you know i got out i got out of the military and wish i had stayed in longer so yeah it ultimately i'm glad i did that. no never saw combat i was in an 80 86 and 87 those years and i was in the cold war era i was stationed on the. and my ship was dry dock for a little while so i didn't i didn't see combat they didn't have combat at that time. how easy was it for you to go. i think it was too easy for me i just did actually i just did real well getting out and and i'm getting back into civilian life i went in with it with both feet running and so yeah it was it was wasn't hard at all. alright. what did you do. after the military. i work several different jobs looking didn't thinking about what career i wanted to choose i apply for the sheriff's department didn't make the sheriff's department but got into working for different private investigative companies at that time and that's how i ended up working and getting into workman's comp fraud and different surveillance and investigative aspects of a private investigation so i work 5 investigation a little time after getting out of the military. how did serving in the military change you. it taught me honor atami dignity you taught me respect it it taught me how to. to listen and obey chain of command it kind of grew me up a groupme app from a kid to a man in a lot of ways like i said i wish i had stayed in longer to have grown more but i did. how have you been feeling lately. lately i been feeling. just really i don't know just kind of worthless you know depressed a lot kind of a little bit worthless. feeling like i don't know maybe a little bit a little lack of hope in a lot of ways not knowing what my future holds and i guess you could say and i don't know just feeling a little down in the last couple weeks. have you noticed any changes in her behavior. yeah this feeling kind of hopeless and just depressed and not having a lot of energy and and. like i said just feeling down just feeling just feeling down about myself now not feeling worthy you know those kind of feelings. all right. how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep. depends on the night sometimes i i sleep really well other nights it's restless i have bad dreams things like that but lately i've just been kind of feeling depressed i've been sleeping too much. what are you. sometimes i get irritable. i can't think straight i might my mind's a jumble. are you. i just can't think straight and and irritable and may be cranky things like that. yes. yes i am actually take medication for to get counseling for it and i've been dealing with that for a little while now but yeah i have been diagnosed with ptsd. how long ago when he died. nice excuse me several years ago. my earphones coming off a little bit but yeah several years ago. tremors at night nightmares depression. feeling feeling low something something bad is going to happen to me at all times you know that's how i felt when i was in the military i feel like our ship was going to be bombed anytime just being feeling a sense of terror a lot of the time. are they triggered by something no that's the strange part about it it's just. it's just the way i feel i don't know why it's like that i can't tell you but it's it's it's the way the way i've been feeling for 4 years ever since i was in the military i feel that way now like we're going to get bombed something's going to happen at any moment a cast is going to break out things like that and i can hate it i wish it was like that which i didn't think that way. how do you cook with them. isolate sometimes and and try to i pray i believe in god so i pray and i try to get him to comfort me in and help me to get through the the scary feelings i feel and i try to get support from the little friends i have in the few family members i have and i just try to tell myself everything's going to be okay it's it's not what i'm thinking you know things aren't the way i think they're they are in my head those those kind of coping mechanisms. i couldn't take it anymore i was having a. still pressing up in the hospital. this feeling like i said feeling tired of being scared all the time couldn't i just couldn't deal with it anymore so i ended up getting help and i'm glad i did and it's a day-by-day struggle i still struggle everyday to to do skip by but i basically i'm doing okay i'm hanging in there. it's very hard. yeah i go to therapy like probably once a month i take meds for it helps me out a lot. i probably should be going to therapy more but it's once a month right now. all right. you feel therapy in hughesville. i think it's useful if you're serious about it and you take it seriously and you have the right therapist and everything is. the right dynamics are there i think it's very useful yeah. well i think that. if you if you go if you're going just to go it's not going to help if you're going to seat the true answers to get help i think it's it's going to it's going to work it's good you're going to get help it's good things will work out but if you've got the wrong person to talk to their that the chemistry is not there or the education or whatever dynamics are involved aren't working they're not in sync with each other either on your side of the of the therapist is there is going to be. more difficult for the for the solution to be a positive when i think. i don't know i i i don't know if i said that properly but basically yeah. let's sort of changes have i noticed. i'm more of a positive person actually that i that i ever have been was completely negative about everything for so many years i'm more positive i have more hope even though i have days of hopelessness more hope i feel more secure within myself and i feel like i've got a release i've got somebody that i could talk to. that will then understands me and somebody that could really relate with. when is the. you know. i don't remember the last time i was very happy to be honest with you i don't remember. it's a. i don't remember it's been a long time. let's see my brother my older brother. he's a real positive influence in my life my best friend. she's a rub super positive person in my life every time i start talking negative or looking down on things she always reminds me be positive be positive and that helps a lot and she's there to encourage me and those two people right there or play a big role in my life. how do your best friend is. oh boy i have i think she probably describe me as. somebody that needs to take things more seriously when it comes to his health is spirituality life itself. somebody that has a lot of issues but yet she cares very much about. tell me about something you did recently. let's see something i've done recently that i've really enjoyed that i've really enjoyed i enjoyed going over my brother's house and watching seeing him work on his harley-davidson he's building a harley-davidson from the ground up so i enjoyed going over there and seeing him get almost finished building this harley from the ground up that was something i really enjoyed doing. nice. what are you most proud of. i guess it would. okay thank you. goodbye.,1,0,2,0.8533368,0.14666325,,,,,698
21,83,"hello. she seems nice. boys size 10. when she says goodbye. okay. yes. all right little tired. awesome. i grew up just outside of philadelphia and i move to los angeles i'm almost 5 years ago. weather for sure also i was a film major in business minor in school so i came out to be involved in entertainment. traffic smog some of the people are a little flaky but i generally like la. no quite the opposite i consider myself an extrovert. enjoy reading. get a glass of wine perhaps throw on an old movie try to get out of the apartment and maybe take a walk something like that. cruelty. people not using their people being careless or thoughtless you know not really giving consideration to other people when they knew things. usually vocalize my annoyance like unless i figured would be really inappropriate in the moment but i'll usually let somebody know as gently as possible then i'm kind of annoyed with what's going on. usually pretty good but i also you know there's like a limit point where i go past and it's like that i cannot control it really anymore so i have a long fuse but. hadabah large amount of dynamite there sometimes. i had an argument with my girlfriend recently and it was. you know we're very different communication styles so. i guess. i was not feeling heard and she was not feeling like my response was appropriate at the time maybe. i was a film and media arts major and business minor and i actually got my masters of business administration it. right now i'm looking for work preferably something entertainment-related but i will take anything that will help pay the bills and let me continue living on the west side. i what i really wanted to do was to produce films so that was sort of my concentration in the film major and i did a couple of internships for production companies as an undergrad end in in my master's program and i like working with creative people and developing stories and developing projects and being the person that can go from the business and legal people to the creative people on try to make everyone happy and make some money. i tried to i mean i'm a little low on funds right now but i really enjoy traveling i drove cross-country when i moved from philadelphia to la so i drove down the east coast to savannah then all through the south and the southwest i've been to england four times i've been to continental europe twice lot of the islands montreal. it's only place i've been to in canada but a lot more of the us and also asia africa australia those places i've not been to yet but i'd love to go. what's a may be the first time i ever left the country first time ever went to europe we got to take the train to glacier express through the alps in switzerland and was unbelievable with the snow and things like that and i took a lot of pictures and i don't know if it's one of the most beautiful things i've ever seen so really sticks out in my mind. i'm very close with my parents i talked with my mom on the phone probably two or three times a week i just talked to my father for father's day the other day and you know he always he sends me emails of news things that you found interesting or stuff that's related to. film and things like that so i'm close my sister like i have a niece and a nephew on very close with them i talked to my sister a decent amount and i always see them when i'm home for the holidays but they're all in the philadelphia area so i'm i'm not physically around them only maybe once a year twice at the most if there's a wedding or something like that. there's been a lot. definitely my parents some of my teachers in high school and that sort of encouraged me. like my social studies microcultures professor my one of my english teachers my phone program i did a summer internship program twice and they had one of her professors for my film. 101 class like was the moderator for that so kept in touch with him as well. i like it a lot better now. my last roommate was only you somebody from the mba program also was a year behind me and he was a terrible roommate he just moved out so i was replaced by somebody else who is. young and nice and he has the money for rent and he has a rabbit and he's just like he's a pretty cool guy so got a decent-sized place i've got the bigger bedroom of the two and the rent is not too bad and i get to live like in culver city mar vista side of town which i really enjoy so i like where i live and the rent is not bad for the neighborhood not at all but a little broke right now so i got to get back working again and and. calm down the the money situation but the living situation itself is fine. i have one roommate yes. no i have not. yes. well i mean i guess in college i was seeing a cognitive therapist for a while. but i've never medication anything like that and i kind of got away from it but. last summer but about a year ago, came back and i was being the individual counselor at school i was doing group counseling sessions and they had me on wellbutrin. so i guess a year. yes. i had a dui which you know all of my drinking i think was really predicated more about the depression not being able to handle that properly so that was part of it and then just the stress of school he was having problems they're having problems in my relationship and you know is that okay really low point and i felt terrible so i decided i should probably do whatever i could do in order to get better. okay. not took a leave of absence from school so that's not really available to me but i still go to like a surprise sobriety support group and you know if they're going back to school to possibility so i might john go back to doing the counseling sessions there but my health insurance runs out in like two months so i don't really have i won't really have a way to see someone unless i see department of. health or something like that so we'll see. i definitely think that there people that are probably on medication that are not in therapy that probably should be i'd rather do therapy without medication the medication therapy that is for sure so i definitely think it's a it's a positive to. speak with something on a regular basis who is sort of removed from your life and objective about it and. don't just listen that's really the most important part is i'm coming to listen. yeah me just having dedicated time of like an hour or so you know 50 minutes whenever two or somebody gets to listen to what's going on with you and and offer some possible. guidance in that direction you know in the direction you want to go i think is always positive. and force you to be like more mindful of what actually bothering yourself when you have to vocalize in and tell them what you're feeling and try to help figure out why and what you can do about it i think that's always a good thing. that my mood has been a lot better. that was a really down black time that last oppressive. so. it's been a lot more. like the future and what i'm doing and. the way i'm thinking about things and it supposed to just like stumbling through an existing i'm like trying to think more about what i really want to in what i believe in the things that are healthy for me and. all the stuff in the should be should been doing before but wasn't. i'm settling in for the moon. i wasn't drinking often but when i was i was drinking to get drunk i was very very down there was some weight gain i was sleeping a lot to enjoy as much and i was worried about money i was worried about where with recommend i decided which i still am to an extent but it's not like bringing me down so much now. caught up in a down. like a rut that i couldn't get out of. i think it was probably just. not feeling successful in the things i wanted to do and i just got swept up in the day-to-day of like oh well i don't have a job and i don't have any money and i'll try to figure it out and i'll do this interview and that's not going to really delete anything and it was just a very. you know i wasn't moving anywhere wasn't i was stuck in one spot like that. about not drinking. i'm just to let you know try to be a little bit more mindful of what i'm doing and why i'm doing it you know if i get if i end up in back in school again i'm going to definitely take up the counseling sessions again i don't know if i want to be back on medication i don't like that was good for the time frame it was in but i don't have to become everything or just good i'm trying to get back in shape now i join the gym and figure that's going to help me to but the main thing is going to be figuring what to do my life cuz i'm 30 now so i feel like i'm to get the real career started. okay just really worried about the money situation because i don't have the student loans to fall back on anymore and stuff so i'm pretty broke pens doing it again. nice. probably more positive now i would say in general i still love that the temper switch like i'm i'm still on. the same things that bother me in the past still bother me but they're not permanently like getting me down there just i would be upset about something in the moment and need to express that and then figure out a solution or let it go as opposed to staying in that funk so i can more resilient definitely. yeah most of the time. like i said if i do get upset about things i'm not somebody who likes to keep things inside. but even getting mountain pass wouldn't really get me through them you know would be something i'd really have to slog through it would take me down for sure but now i feel a little bit more comfortable with feeling i'm feeling and getting a house and then trying to work through it. some days i do you know but it's not everyday and it's not like for no particular reason anymore i mean i may be down because i'm stressed out cuz i have such a problem that you know i need to address in the in life like my lack of funds right now and you not trying to get in bad shape and you know trying to figure out what to do with my education that i have so far and find what i want to do like that something that people should be worried about but i don't feel like it's any anxiety or anything like that as we know our sadness or fear is dominating anymore. how is your day. i'm usually okay i've been. going to bed later and wake me up later and since i've not had a job so that is something i need to watch out for cuz i really need to start waking up earlier in order to apply for things and go you don't meet people in person and try to figure something out on the job site of things but i'm i'm sleeping okay i'm not. being sleepless or anything like that there are definitely some days where i feel like staying in bed sometimes but. physically i feel okay. that sucks i mean i've definitely i almost feel like i've liked cold symptoms 5 only get four or five hours of sleep or something like that i won't know the runny nose i'll feel a little feverish i'll be hungry at weird times like i'll just be very run down and i did i don't like that feeling at all i try to get likes every 8 hours sleep every night. probably when i was home over the holidays for the holidays i could spend half my parents and my niece and nephew and my sister and i got to see some of my old friends i got to see some of my extended family generally good feeling and is also my mom's birthday on the 27th of december so that was a fun occasion as well. i would say very intelligent very funny a little bit too intense a little bit crazy but nobody loyal also generally a. a good person a nice person. i work a lot of things in my life i've done some things like that to you i definitely regret that you know i dropped out of the first college that i went to cuz things are really going badly for me at that time and i kind of regret that i think it might have been the right thing to do but i wish i would have been nice to be able to finish school you know on time and start a career that way you know i generally try to behave the way i would feel couple sleeping at night after work but you know everybody fails it something so anytime i've lied any time i've caught something any time i've felt like i've wasted an opportunity. she's inquisitive.",0,0,2,0.84769785,0.15230212,,,,,603

27,130,okay cool. hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today. yes i am. i am pretty good. i was born in los angeles california. yes. i like the fact that everything is closed by all the stores and shops. the traffic. i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot of trouble but not too much. going away from your usual days exploring new sites. 3 weeks notice a month ago i went to las vegas with me and my friends and we just went sightseeing. in las vegas we went to the hoover dam and it was breathtaking the it was really big and we saw the big canyon and it was impressive i never seen something like that before. i studied nursing. i graduated two months ago so i took my board exam to be licensed and i passed so i'm just waiting for my license in the mail. my dream job is to be a registered nurse. long time ago when i was a little boy i got injured and my parents had to take me to the hospital and the doctors came by and they had to stitch me up on the leg and i saw all of that and that made me want to pursue the medical field. are you happy. yes i am very happy. my relationship with my family is okay not good not bad it's if it's in between. i am close i am very close to them if i have a problem or i go to them for help. someone who's been a positive influence has been my best friend since elementary school. yes. yes we've known each other since we were in the third grade and we've we've gone to a lemon tree middle school and high school together and he lives like two blocks away so he's basically like like a brother of mine. i am shy. i really don't know i've always been a quiet person ever since i can remember. what do i do if i. i going to my room i turn my ac on and i just relax in my bed. i am pretty good i'm pretty good at controlling my temper yes. the last time i argued with someone was about. work. i was disappointed not angry just disappointed. because my manager he wanted me to do something faster than what i usually can handle and he already knew that my workload was a lot but he didn't understand that so that made me just very like sad. i cannot remember one. the hardest decision i ever had to make was. dropping out of school. i felt that i didn't really belong far away from home and so i was just thinking ahead i was in a major that i didn't really like and so. i decided to just not go next semester and go back home to la. are you happy. right now that i'm looking at it yes i am very happy that i did that because i wouldn't have gone to nursing school and i wouldn't have been a licensed vocational nurse right now. i don't have an event. how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep. it depends on the days where i work or where i don't work. yes right now i i work at at a retail store early in the morning i i go at 3 in the morning and i get out at 10 a.m. so it's really hard for me to get a good night sleep. when i don't sleep well i can be a little bit grumpy irritated or just frustrated with the situation. lately i've been okay i'm been good. no i have not. okay. no. no. the last time i was really really happy and excited was when i found out that i passed my license board exam to be a nurse. my best friend would have just would describe me as a caring nice sweet shy quiet guy. physically speaking i would change how i look from the outside. i am overweight and i would like to lose some weight and just look good from the outside. i don't have one. no i don't. just one time. i at my work it's a retail store i kind of took some merchandise without buying it. what made you decide to do that. it was a risk that i took but since no one was around and d up the opportunity was right there for me to get it i just got it and i took it home. i don't know. yes last weekend i went to i went yard selling with my family and it was pretty fun going out to different yard sales and finding random stuff. i bought this big black bean bag it was huge and it was on it was only for $2 and so i got it and now it's in my room and i sit on it. i am most proud of is the fact that i am a nurse that i am a nurse i'm just waiting for my for my license in the mail and after that i would just send out my resumes to different hospitals and call aunt nursing homes. i think i got everything i need. thanks for sharing your thoughts. bye.,0,0,2,0.79725367,0.20274638,,,,,463
28,131,set reminder after she says goodbye. yeah sure. i'm all right i'm in a weird test study right now. i'm from los angeles. all kinds of different things to do in the city. well. i don't know if she cherry is a little different and it's hard to get boring around here. you know the traffic in the smog and all that. i'm sure you can tell by my. not as much as i'd like to. money mainly lack of money. i'd like to see in the world and seen all the different places. went to went to russia 3 years ago. i like to go into the church's we did a huge trip of all the churches in the area. music for the most part. i've been playing music for a long time. are you still working. yeah. didn't musician touring performing musician. really really really hard. a lot of competition and luck involved. i agree. little enough. getting probably just that i play a lot of music sit down with a guitar for a little while. i would say good i think i'm a calm person. i'm having difficulty even remembering. nothing big in a long time. i'm having difficulty thinking of one on the spot right now. i have not sure i can't think of anything. when you feel guilty. guilty. when i was a boy i stole a little golden bicycle from an old lady. not proud of it. i'm not ideal i'd live with my parents and 23 years old. and that's becoming more and more awkward. i think. i don't know i think things are improving i need to move out. i need to get my own apartment and then we can come back around to be friends i'm sure with my parents. there's a lot of positive influences in my life i've got a good group of friends you know my family i love them nonetheless but. how is your day. easy i would say. what are you like when he died. come. not not as groggy as some people get it i don't know i'd. just in general. well and say things are all right. nothing huge. i had a really good band practice last night with all the friends i felt really good about that. generally funny and good to be around. work ethic i think is a big one. sure. you know i have a lot of projects that have planned for myself in my life and i have difficulty completing them. i like to use space as an excuse that's my go-to one i don't have a good studio to record music or. tell me about a time when some. well okay let's this current band that i'm working with. i was told i'm a part-time member in this band and i was told that. you know i wasn't officially in the car group and stuff i feel pretty bad about that for a few days. is there anything you regret. in life. maybe going maybe finishing college that might be something. i know it just never i never came to pass that i would transfer to a 4-year university and get a bachelor's degree. best qualities i think generally that easygoingness and good sense of humor. play that i really enjoyed last weekend i went camping on a beach with a bunch of friends that was nice. was proud of. i guess you know musical accomplishments i put a lot of work into that and i'm finding success in my way. thank you. he has interesting goodbye. hit this button. interesting.,0,0,2,0.81839657,0.18160346,,,,,476
29,133,"oh so she's like going to be counselor kind of. and then i just press that. and then we just have that again and they're done cool. haikal. are you okay. yes. i'm actually i feel pretty good cuz i i i slept all day yesterday almost i'm usually doing something if not work it's cool if it's not school it's work and then social life and all that so i actually didn't have work yesterday and i don't have school on have school on the weekdays so i actually slept probably like 85% of the days i actually feel kind of good but i'm actually kind of tired as well i have other stuff going on but other than that i'm good today. okay. i'm originally from bakersfield california. really. i'm so late when i was an infant and i'm left here when i was around 3 or 4 and i've been moved i moved back here in 07 and i've been living here ever since. well since i've been here since 07 i've only been back maybe. maybe like. couple why were there at 4 like a summer like in 08 i think i was there for like almost all summer but i don't even back up a couple times and since i've been back here. unfortunately. it compared to la doesn't really compare. i grew up in sacramento actually i didn't get to tell you i was born in bakersfield and i lived here anyways i don't know if i did i forgot anyways yeah there's like nothing really to do there it's really small as to valley la has all the stuff to do has oceans and his file kinds of located on by a lot of cool places like vegas and san diego and what have you not but yeah other than that i miss my friends and stuff that i don't miss like actual city i just missed some of the people that i grew up with. i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot i can't see your shoes but i don't travel after i've only been out of california like six time so i would like to travel inside. have enough money to do so. i want to be a filmmaker and which i still want to be a filmmaker and i said i was 10 i took communications and the general that stuff too and took my video production classes and did a lot of stuff in regards to i'm filmmaking and i have learned a lot of stuff and i still have that knowledge however i haven't really used it since i've been back here in la i did all that stuff in northern california in sacramento but and then i transfer switch over to be at the business which i took some classes in that but now i'm actually studying to be an optician and i'm actually almost done with schooling and getting ready to try to get infield and become an optician so. but i do want to be i still want to be a filmmaker and i'm that still one of my plans and i still actually i got into i'm playing poker 2 years ago and i really like the idea of becoming a full-time filmmaker or full-time poker player have it both of those jobs are extremely difficult to make a living out of it have to be like a small percent so we'll see if not then hopefully my optician career could take me somewhere. 3 oxygen. i guess i was just trying to find something that it was like it it's like a trade it supposed to private college but it just like specifically trained you into one feel then you just learned that you don't do like your ged and all these other classes like you normally do for like like a major or whatever you're going to do so it just trains you to civically to be auditioning and jump in the field i took it just because i actually want to be a dental assistant sound like something maybe i could do it sounds interesting but then the counselor actually got my attention to be optician so i'm now trying to be an optician and it's interesting so it's fine it's really hard but it's interesting in it and it and it's it's fine. we want to benefit this far as like being able to help people see better and feel comfortable with glasses or contact lenses whatever they feel welcome for what. i'm definitely outgoing however i can be shy sometimes like i'm kind of shy right now because talking to you and your computer and your cartoon or animated or whatever but no usually 98%. i turn on the. hey. but it's the best i've got. i actually was actually kind of funny and i think maybe this might go further some of the poker players to really i've never really talked to any professional poker player to be as far as like i actually playing poker is actually something that helps me forget about anything as far as like. stuff in the past or present or future stuff is coming up as far as like i am really would i really do not think about anything and just think about poker and it actually it's kind of like a therapy thing for me cuz i don't like i guess you could say the kind of drug because i don't think about anything as far as like stressed out or depressed our stuff that's happened in the past i just like focus on poker so it's actually kind of relieved and however playing poker is very stressful on top of that so i guess it's kind of like a catch-22 or whatever but yeah so no poker i put like to play basketball i like to watch movies i can go to the beach actually one of the things i like to do is go to the beach cuz it does it makes me feel good but i usually when you go to the beach when it's hot. during the cold season so it's coming up soon so looking forward to that i'm really busy but i'll try to go to the beach because i can't. i'm really good at controlling my temper actually i've only been in like i'm 30 years old i've been in like six fights maybe and all six of them were started by the other person so i've never started a real fight in my whole life like i started fighting a little kid but talking about like a real stuff like what you get past like 13-14 but yeah i know i'm good like every now and then like there's been in the past were like i wasn't able to control it. but as far as i ever being violent or anyting that's never occurred and never would but for the majority of the time yeah i don't have like people do stupid things all the time and i just like let it go expect to like i'm on the freeway and stuff but. oh i mean i get about with my ex girlfriend a lot but it was just about really petty things i guess that maybe we just i think we were good for each other but maybe some other lifetime because we just bumped head too much so obviously she's my ex-girlfriend probably for a reason so. we just argued about girlfriend boyfriend thing. i guess my film. there's a lot of stuff i got to handle differently about. maybe like when i was doing really good when i was younger and i was working for. production assistant for a filmmaker's around where i live in sacramento so i was doing everything that i want to do as far as my dreams are concerned and had a lot on my stuff together i have my own car mode apartment and then i got involved with like the wrong group of people i guess and kind of tumble down hill from there in like lost everything like our apartment so i just wish that maybe i never got involved with those kind of people that kind of girl ever. because i would probably a pirate my life probably a lot different now however i believe that everything happens for a reason and obviously i think you should also like stuff that happens good or bad. learn from your mistakes so that when it happens again you could not make that mistake our try not to make it as bad yes so you know. i guess. hardest decision. the hardest decision i have ever had the maid would be. i guess you could say i don't really know. can i say that i. maybe like my ex-girlfriend like i couldn't like. stayed with her and i really like it still am in love with her and would like to be with her and miss her but i guess the biggest decision that i had to make was like i know that wasn't like a healthy relationship and i know if we like stay together if we got married or have kids that i don't think would end up working out anyways so i guess the decision the hardest decision would be till like actually stay away from her and not get back with her and not with her so i guess that was a hard really hard decision because i could easily have done it and i guess maybe i would have been happier that way but stressed out and irritable or whatever and other way of having to deal with her iguess deal with each other our relationship so it's really hard still is so i guess that's not choosing to be with someone that i loved and loved me. or whatever so. what was that. i beg your pardon. navad. i understand the first part of that question. oh an event own event okay that can erase. event that i can erase for my memory. imax girlfriend i wish i never met her. my first girlfriend in my last girlfriend i wish i never met them cuz we were we were together and love for a few years and then we broke up and it was really hard so i guess both of them. how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep extremely i could fall asleep anywhere i actually the other day i broke a record i almost fell asleep standing up which would have been weird because i guess i would have fallen down or something i don't know i just caught myself i guess i was i mean i was really tired but i do a lot of stuff so it's hard for i don't really get that much sleep. as much as i would like but i can sleep when i'm dead or whatever. have they said. i know. no. lately i'm just tired but i'm all right i guess i'm dealing with this breakup still it's only been like a month and a week but it's actually is not i mean i've had worse things happen i mean worst things happening had worse things happen to us. well-known religious person that i'm catholic i believe in god i know there's a god so obviously even though all of it even devoted people to god regardless of what they are they sometimes stay so i do stay sometimes but definitely last for that long and i know that there is a god and i know that i'll be okay and everything will be okay but you know it's hard to deal with them like i don't really i just keep going and i go to school and work and i just have to keep going i can't give up so i just try to stay busy and staying busy helps kind of been like sleeping a lot house but i don't go to sleep a lot so i don't know playing poker. playing basketball helps me deal with him hanging out with my friend sometime. i felt really happy on friday because i went to san diego for the first time and i didn't it wasn't as cool as i thought it would be but we're like under circumstances as far as like my friend had business to take care of and it took a long time so i would much rather been free during that time but i wasn't but we had fun it was cool i enjoyed it so yeah i really like that i was at fun and i was happy about going to san diego for the first time and i am had a good time. a lot of things but i guess i would say like be nicer to like family members know a couple family members that i wish i would have been different to. at the different to not that i was like a horrible but i could have been nicer in some instances that if i didn't know the situation at hand and i would have never like really went out and partied all the time like i did like highschool different part times of a type i would have just really focused on schooling and stuff them in to the party later would have gotten relationships that i'm sorry i just told myself more basely to be more have more direction be more focused i guess i stay away from people and unhealthy relationships and healthy people i guess not that i'm the healthiest but yeah i just want it done a lot of stuff different but i don't know if she said earlier but i believe everything happens for a reason. so i guess everything is happening now for reason something to keep going. i guess there's a few that i do have a few that i used to have cuz i have best friends now couple i guess one new one and i've lost a few best friends as far as like just not we like 100 ways but i guess they're all probably describe me more as like energetic funny crazy loud silly. smart and i just i guess in general just like entertaining to be around i have. i haven't always been the best bestest best friend but i tried you know my hardest. so that's cool. change myself. i wish i was. i wish i was like 15 pounds lighter. i wish i didn't need. how do i set potatoes i feel like. i feel like i'm i feel like i need to be like in a relationship with a girl but i feel like i wish i didn't have to be like feel like that i needed to have a girl all the time and so i get that, like focus more and i wish that like i didn't need sexual i wasn't always think about sexual stuff towards girls all the time as far as like me having to be in a sexual thing with them like as far as like wanting sex as much as i do cuz i feel like if i didn't concentrate our have to like be with girls are in a relationship to like well i don't know how to say it but i was saying like there's a guy friends that i know that don't need sex as much as i do and i feel like i need it more than i feel like sometimes that i wish i didn't need as much so maybe i guess i'm addicted to it a little bit more like i can focus on more things other than just i mean i don't just focus on sex but i just feel like if i focused on it if i didn't want it need it or think i need it as much that i could get. step dad in my life. but that sometimes i'm working on that. what am i most proud of. i'm most proud of. almost i guess i guess i'm most proud of working for television station back in sacramento and working on a lot of them film sets cuz like i i was 16 and i decided i want to be a filmmaker and then two years later or year-and-a-half later you basically i got i started making steps to become a filmmaker and then i ended up working in the business and working as a filmmaker for a really really really good i'm cinematographer i really good i'm freelancing to target for those that lives in sacramento that deal i think so i'm proud that i had a dream and i went for it and i actually ended up doing stuff to go toward my dream that were in my dream so i guess that's one of my biggest accomplishment which was like over 10 years ago but i know hopefully something like that could happen again soon or no. perfect. goodbye. cool.",0,0,2,0.80101264,0.19898733,,,,,407

31,143,to do another thing that. oh wow. samsung one more time i realize. who started the virtual human. okay. okay. i thank you ma'am. are you okay. yes. i'm okay. how far am i los angeles california recently. yes. sunshine the weather is great. got it. small collusion crime. certain things like that yeah. i dated one point in my life i was in the military so i don't do hardly a lot of traveling no more. seeing different sites different people i think it's more of the people and being around different types of city and the pepsi meeting different new people. i travel to. new york one time and it was quite different big city. different people it's about it. 18. yes i was. i know i did a lot of combat training but no contact. discipline more. more motivated you get a lot of things done more even when you don't want to do them you know you just go back to your army days and you get motivated off the stuff that day that you really needed to get done but you didn't want to do it but they got there. like. you had to do a lot of cleaning you had to wake up pretty early you had to do a lot of pt you had to stay up to like 2 or 3 in the morning and you didn't wake back up until 4:05. starting point yes. after the military i join the national guard and i did 15 16 years and there i was. excuse me ma'am i didn't hear the choir that one. what made me decide to do that just the motivation just me and i'll really wanted a career see if i could find a career from it and it helped me out a little bit you. thank you. it wasn't that easy. i mean i'm sorry it was easy it didn't bother me too much to go back to the civilian life. yeah i didn't bother me at all i just adjusted pretty well. history basically a lot. just basically history. no i'm not disabled. oh no it's okay it's okay we can go i can heal i can get better hopefully i will. yes i try to keep up. scooter man. i guess my dream job will probably be working with others working with young people working with kids saying that they get the right and proper education that you know. that's due to them so they can be productive in life of society as we live in today. excuse me. what i think about him i think they should be more more i mean they should listen to piss up eight more and what they're doing in their lives they should ask more questions they should be more motivated to really achieve something within their lives to give them to give them the confidence in the motivation they need a life cuz i don't get it. when i see people do really really stuff that they really shouldn't be doing. it really eats me i mean really bothers me and when people talk to you they give you the run-around it's like won't you just be straight with me instead of just give me the runaround when you just be straight up with me. i can be very frustrating and real when people to really i'm trying to find the right words to good stuff that really bothers me too. spray painting on the wall. jess. going garbage anywhere not picking it up not really being you know not really being. hygiene you know taking care of yourself and being hygiene you know what i mean. when i do when i'm annoyed i get really upset i really start really cussing people out to be honest with you and it's something that's not really me but i'm learning to really let go of it a lot to know just so you know just say hey that's the way it is it's like i'm not in control i can't control it. yeah i only have to control the things about what i do and really getting upset off of what other people do is not really good it's not good for me. all my timbers camping control i can show the pretty well. i think it probably would but my sister and she's very controlling and it's like you have your life and i have mine don't tell me what to do. yeah. we were so close i can get along with him for real clothes i have no problems with them. yeah very good. this morning. yeah wake up pretty you know out at first thing i do when i wake up in the morning i pray so we'll nice spirits in connection with the the universe in the world i feel pretty good. yes. up and down uno up because i'm motivated to get out and start doing other things in life and just not doing anything at all and then the times where you want to get something accomplished and you can't really get it done because there's roblox in the way but i'm learning how to overcome those roadblocks as well. well for instance looking to go to school and i was having problems getting enrolled in school i was talk to one of my social workers and she was willing to help me get online and the do it so i'm like okay it was going to get done. yeah. can you repeat that one more time out. yes i have. that had to be the last couple of weeks i noticed that i go through certain situations like he was talking about the anger situation is like i don't get angry all the time that's not me so sometimes when i get angry i have to find out what's causing all this what's what's causing me to get angry. and i have to take schism now. it's not hard at all cuz you have to do is just take your time in the reflect about everything that you have gone through and take a good look at the situation and and then go from there and find out what's really bothering you. it's very seldom i suffer from ptsd and getting that type of sleep would be would be great. because i have recurring nightmare so of an incident so. i i think it is and i don't know what is triggered by but i think it is and that's why i'm talking to someone or seeing someone cuz i'm a veteran at the va about the situation now. about to ptsd basically right now. change mail. a lot of nightmares lot of problems lot of anger issues depression i noticed all this in me and. i started. just started to just tell myself i need it out. and as that's basically i just so you know i just you know i did something wrong with the one right with me and when something's not right with me i have to take time out to just take a good look at myself and ask myself if something's right then you did something right then that's fine something not right then you need to take care of it and just start shaking help down there yeah. someone yes it is someone. because i'm able to sit down and talk to the therapist. well i'm able to sit down and talk to the therapist and tell him i situation and we usually will go over to the problem and i went to classes i've been to talking one-on-one with my own doctor so it's helping a little bit. yeah that's a good thing. sketch map. no no not really. my best friend. they he will describe me as a fun-loving good person always there. try to help others think more about is really them more myself but when i know i needed things need to be done for me i take care of it so you know they really actually they really look up to me they have a lot more respect for me. yeah they see something in me they wished that they at. gmail. can you be a little bit more specific. okay. books crossword puzzles walking that's about it. i thought i did but i don't think i do i don't think i regret anything because. this is this is how it is this is the way it is for me so i accept it and i keep moving on. because if i regret anything in the past then i'm wasting my time on that because it's gone that's the past i need to move on i need to live in the present so i can be prepared for the future like move on to the future. yeah. more education. being more direct and more confidence in what i'm doing like i am today so yeah that's what i was lacking maybe 20 years ago. yes i have had a lot of pots of the people been been in my life. yes i'm people with can consistently motivate me to continuing to pursue a certain goal and i thought that was pretty good because i really don't see that a lot and. they gave me a lot of motivation to try to go up and try to do so i can think of anything that you do it's a choice it's up to you whether or not if you do it or not that choice is still up to you for it to be done. excuse me ma'am. that i'm able to really be able to be self-motivated and really be able to put my best foot forward and be able to get a lot of things accomplished. thought i couldn't but it can be accomplished if i'm willing enough to put the will to it to do it. paul wow huh. oh really and you know what i really enjoyed was sitting down with my social worker and we're talkin about getting things done within my life and school was one of them and just being just school was one of my kind of liked it that because i was the first time someone was willing to really sit down with me and work with me. yeah and i thought that was a great dane so as long as you're willing to do that and i'm willing to go even the extra mile and even be motivated to do other things besides school. and then then that's what gets me going. so it is and i love it and this is going to be accomplished. thank you. goodbye. yeah i think she's through. jackass she was really human wow before technology.,1,0,2,0.50367403,0.49632603,,,,,344
32,153,"okay. and please. are you okay with this yes. i'm doing okay. i'm from greenwich connecticut. yes. i moved here in 2008 so about 5 years ago. i try to go back at least once a year sometimes i go more sometimes less. overall i think i like where i'm from better than la in general. that other than it being somewhere i'm familiar with the type of people that are there are just more my type and what i'm used to and less superficial. i understand. monument. all my move got here for college after i graduated high school and my mom and sister live in california. initially it was easy because i felt like it was a new experience so you kind of adapt and just are experiencing everything at once but then after the first few years when it really sets in how different it is and what life is out here it became more difficult than originally. fine arts in photography. i was interested in photography since high school, i did a lot of programs and got awards and things like that and publishments so i decided to pursue art. yes i have a fine arts degree that i got last year and. awesome. are you happy you did that yeah i really enjoy working or interning in forensics i like that better than initially what i wanted to do was freelance photography i feel like it's a more secure job and it's very interesting. centrist in question. i guess just my childhood in general growing up. while my family is very close. my extended family as well and they all most of them live. within the area on the east coast in general so we would always do large family parties and things for holidays and religious purposes and things like that. yeah it is really fun and we try and i'll get together as much as possible which is more difficult now since everyone is spread out amongst different states and countries. i consider myself more shy. sometimes when i'm feeling. hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got. what do you do. i watch reality television i think it's kind of funny and lighthearted. like what i watch like bravo tv like the real housewives shows and. like funny things that you don't really need to pay attention to. i'm good i guess i don't really have like a temper from having if i'm more stressed out it definitely shows in my attitude but i don't have like anger. when was the last time you argue with someone. will me and my boyfriend like bicker all the time just like about like insignificant things but other than that i had an argument with my dad a few days ago. can you tell me about. does ben like some tension going on. since i went and visited over the holidays this past winter things about his girlfriend and he thinks that i should be the one to make some kind of effort to. have a relationship with her although he doesn't for whatever reason think that it should go both ways so for like the 30th time he we were on the phone and he was. telling me how i need to call her and speak to her and i told him that i was going to do it over this past weekend cuz of the jewish holidays and he kind of was just like very mature and telling me you'll forget it she doesn't want to hear from you now and kind of just like i could care less because i i don't care about having a relationship with her so she doesn't want to hear from me you know it's easier for me. i mean every time i mean that's been the same recurring argument a lot and i wish. that i could sometimes i do but i wish that the times that it turns into an explosive fight that i could just bite my tongue but the thing is is that he says certain things that are untrue or thinks he knows that like will take me off that are really nasty and that he shouldn't be saying to me so he so i kind of just like lose it and i can't really. like not say anything. well i guess the hardest decision i made which i didn't really realize that it's the hardest decision like looking back is once you decide where to go after you graduate high school where you go to college because for me i've basically changed my entire life and moved away and did all that on my own. so it didn't seem like that hard of a decision at the time it felt like just like the progression of the next step but looking back now that's probably one of the hardest decisions i made. tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. i wish i could erase. the event or seeing my grandmother's funeral which obviously it wouldn't change anything but. it wasn't seeing her there was not something i'd want to like have in my memory. come she was she was a very positive influence and always was not judgmental. and now i mean my parents are great role models just in general i mean they're very successful people. so whether or not we have like disagreements or that were separate people they kind of are good role models in terms of what you want to have when you are older. usually it's easy the problem is staying asleep no matter how late i go to bed whether it's 10 p.m. or 4 a.m. i will be up like clockwork by 7:30 or 8 in the morning the latest every single day and i can't seem to figure out why i cannot stay asleep longer. i need to record buy something no i just in the morning i guess i'm a lighter sleeper but i just wake up like i just cannot stay asleep anymore which never used to be a problem this is consistent but now it's i cannot remember the last time i slept past 8:30 in the morning. i mean it just makes if i have to do stuff during the day and makes a lot more tiring but it doesn't really i'm so used to it now it doesn't really change my mood it's just part of every day. okay. how you doing lately. i don't know i kind of just feel very. like so so just. no extreme highs no extreme lows kind of one no land. i mean nothing like lately. like recently it's just i would say over a. of years i kind of progressively become more seclusive and just reserved and. not very outgoing. no. no i have been diagnosed with anxiety. i had some breathing problems for a day or two and i had to go to the hospital cuz i thought it was more serious cuz i couldn't breathe but they said that it was a physical manifestation of my anxiety. i think in the right setting and. with the person who's doing it if they're open-minded and the therapist. is helpful. and good at what they're doing then yeah. no i haven't been to therapy since i was a kid. i went because my parents thought it would be a good idea to like deal with whatever issues they were having with me. but it was never so i mean we just sat around and talked about my day wasn't it i didn't feel like i needed therapy at the time so i didn't really get much out of it. tell me about. i was happy when i was back home at my boyfriend's house with his family over the new year's holiday when i'm there i can always just we save up our money so it's a complete vacation i don't have to worry about paying bills i don't have to worry about what i have to do tomorrow who i have to deal with i just do every morning we wake up we hang out just enjoy the day. is there anything you regret. in general. i regret the college i chose to go to i didn't leave from the east coast the whole collegiate system is set up a lot differently and the university is out there or not the same as like the tight-knit california school system out here so when i was researching colleges i kind of thought that santa monica college was just a general college just like boston college back home or you know any other school with the name college at the end of it i didn't realize until you know the end of my first year even that it was more like a transfer school like you you can't i didn't even realize you couldn't get a bachelor's degree from there when i went so kind of crate created more problems for me. well cuz they're m22 if probably 10 years ago i would give myself the advice to. probably stay closer to home and 2ave really pursued other options rather than just be completely invested in moving to california. how your best friend describe you. my best friend would describe me as a great charismatic funny outgoing socially enjoyable person which is different than how people who aren't my good friends would describe me. which i mean i don't i mean it is what it is i. i am very outgoing in and have a great time when i'm with my friend in my element but around strangers and in like uncomfortable groups and things i just. i am very shy and. don't really. speak match. recently my friend was visiting and we went to a clippers basketball game a few weeks ago and i really enjoyed that. i'm very caring i am a very good judge of character which i mean i guess it's i mean i consider to be a quality for myself and various i mean never affectionate i'm more. i mean i guess

that like there's something wrong in my eyes no i just thought i was in a doctor's office and they had it on and it's like god it was funny cuz there's these guys like winking at me on the way i like that celebrity 8 dividing sitting there it's like i hated every minute of it but we got sewing machines free sewing machines $200 sewing machines that day it was yeah so it was worth it was worth it but i was so embarrassed yeah only if you get stuff it's worth it otherwise are so stupid shows are so i can't believe that's what i want to television. so embarrassing. oh okay. right on okay this is so weird oh gosh i hope she's nice to me i hope so okay hello. are you okay. yes. fine just tired. california. from hollywood. not too much. talk to me things i like about it. the people. it's not clean. too much crime too many drugs. eye makeup and hair. a little bit. not too much i just arrived. very difficult. i'm getting a little old to be thinking of a career but. i just want probably get married and have a little security that's all just be a wife again. a little bit close but everybody's pretty much passed away. i play farmville on facebook. i'm good i don't really have a temper. with my ex-husband about money. people lying cheating conniving drug addicts you know just ugly people people that are. hideous and inside you know. jesus christ that's about it. my mother when she was alive when she still a positive influence but. nobody really but. jesus. memorable experiences. i don't know i can't really think of one right now. gosh. experiences. all i guess like maybe modeling that was pretty cool yeah. yeah. i was just kind of. thrill like to see yourself in magazines and pictures and stuff you know i didn't understand how it could have been me but then my photographer told me he was like well someone has to do to might as well be you so oh well and it's true so that was cool. just kind of fell into it by accident. i've always yeah yeah i wish i did it i took it further but i couldn't. really happy. i don't remember. i really don't. i really have a best friend but i'm sure. there anybody would describe me as outgoing. no. yes. how was the 1984. yeah. i can deal with it. so i had to see a psychiatrist. horrified couldn't sleep. panicked. major anxiety. oh yeah. yes i do. it could be if you see the right doctor. it gives you the opportunity to talk to somebody and. hopefully they can give you answers must have him don't they try to find the answers and side of you get it out of you but it's just good to be able to talk to somebody that's kind of biased neutral. really depressed. extremely depressed. poverty. yeah. yeah i'm a lot more tired i sleep longer and. i am. i just don't have the drive motivation that i did before. just try to be strong just have to get through it and now. yes. there are. not really. i'm an open book. well i would say perfection is but that's not really good quality cuz it can get dangerous. i'm just artistic i'm good at a lot of things. i'm really good at a lot of things but. well i'm good i'm a good hairdresser makeup artist i crochet and knit really well make jewelry. not good with computers or phones though electronics. yeah. okay perfect house or well when i'm not depressed like this i was a perfect wife the perfect wife. hell yeah. but not anymore cuz i'm divorced now but it wasn't me it was him. he was on drugs so he chose the drugs were too much problems. yeah it does. it's really hard because it's like the drugs are his mistress. how do i what. who. yes. now. well i don't really consider myself an introvert. yeah. i have a lot of regrets but there really wasn't anything i could do about it so there's really no point in regretting it. cuz you do what you do and you make a decision and then. it's already done so why i regret it why bother you no. make sure that when you marry a man that you ask him if he does drugs or alcohol. that's one for sure that was the only question i didn't answer ask i i didn't know. first lot of things. a lot of stuff. i don't know. just the things that i can do. that my talents that's it. well if i can have my starbucks. and my orange gina i drink orange juice everyday and i smoke cigarettes and fortunately but it's always good to have those because you know i'm addicted to them and then it's like it's something really. good and healthy at night time and it will basically if i have something to do if i have a goal of somewhere to go something to do like today then. let's meet a good man yeah otherwise i'd be afraid that i'd stay home and just lay in bed or perform all day i could form for 8 hours on farmville. you're welcome nice to meet you. so i pressed the button. you're good. she's good except for you know it's like the one i can she hear me by the way the one i always come is weird and distracting other than now the one. yeah she kind of made a mistake on one part.,1,0,2,0.55708444,0.4429156,,,,,332
36,164,okay. yes. all good things. the east coast. for work. i rarely. i prefer it out here. it's not as nice as the lifestyle out here i like the weather better and there's a lot of things about living here my favorite city so. somewhat. baby sleep. what's that. just stop i like to go to france a lot i like the food there and just a lifestyle the shopping that sort of thing. art history and marketing. avail. i became interested in high school and i thought it was a good classical education and i interned a dandy warhols magazine when i was in high school and so that. yes. yes. i'm pretty happy with what i'm i'm doing i do consulting so i write marketing plans that sort of thing. it's really hard. about writing a marketing plan. i know it's hard it's hard to talk to someone about who's not marketing it requires just knowledge of you know how it's how it how it's done and it takes several months to to do lunch. well i guess i'm originally kind of shy but i become more outgoing just cuz of work and stuff. i like to exercise i do hiking with my dogs we walk up and down a hill a couple times is that. good. i don't remember. i don't know nothing comes to mind. sometimes i don't i don't clean my car it might get lots of dog hair in it and i feel bad when i tie should always stay on top of that just getting to the carwash and stuff. well i had a conflict with my brother and so i had to decide to have an estrangement from him and that makes the most sense in that was a difficult decision but just because of his angry behavior wasn't it wasn't that difficult but you know what it was somewhat difficult because i i love him very much so. i'm not close to my family so my i don't really have one. i have a japanese friends i think the center came up i have a japanese friend i'm very close but she's like my kind of my mother and. i just met him socially. i don't know nothing comes to mind. yeah i think the sensor came off. ohio. okay okay. easy cuz i keep a regular schedule. i'm just kind of tired maybe a little bit irritable. a good. well i'm recovering from ptsd so i sometimes feel that the ptsd and then i'll take a medication for that. no it's just that it's just left over if that i'm still of the stress from it i'm still being treated for it but they don't really have any. imma try not to talk about it. i'm in the past but it's treated. 5 years ago. i was i was just very sad very depressed and so that's why things iety so i went to the doctor and they helped me that i did a psychotherapy. the app for the ptsd.. i don't know i guess so. it's just i'm just kind of supportive because of the issues i have with my family it's it supportive to have a doctor who is supportive and. yeah it just gets me good feedback and helps me to make a decision that sort of thing. yeah i have nightmares about my family sometime. nah. i just try to sleep better i should i hide it before i go to sleep i sort of like meditate a little bit to get to be calm and then hope that that will help. i do have you all the time pretty much like i am a dog's make me happy and you know my life is really happy. i guess you know it's a nice person thoughtful a good friend. and happy fun person. i don't remember my forties now so i'm pretty happy with myself i don't mind. you know i've done a lot of work on myself and in therapy and stuff so i'm pretty. i wouldn't really change a lot i'm pretty happy with myself and i'm about to sound conceited but i'm i'm pretty happy with myself now. oh that was that would be on my parents they're very abusive so i that i don't talk to them anymore so you know any times with them you know that they did terrible things today so i prefer not to talk about it. i like to see. well i just started reading a book i like to read cookbooks and i was just reading a book called on when french women cook and it's about a woman's relationship with different women in france in different parts of france in the end the cooking and so i'm really enjoying that book. i usually you know i'm get the grocery shopping done which i enjoy i really i really like doing the grocery shopping i go to a few places and then do a bit of cleaning and dime. just i relax. oh yeah i would i would say to have better self-esteem cuz i just have very low self-esteem you know from being abused and so tonight i wish i'd been happier in the past and you know taking me a long time to become unhappy because dinner no matter what it what i did whatever she meant i was i was never happy in the past i was i was always in a struggling with being depressed i didn't even know why and now and i realized because of whatever then set it that it was from my parents that i'm a relationship and so my advice would be to not have a relationship that is bad for you like sometimes estrangement is the best place in abusive relationship. i'm just the way i live my life the way i treat people i think you know. and i i believe it that your deeds are very important that i try to treat people in a good way and i'm proud of my work and i've made that that'll give me a job that i like a lot of flexibility and i got to do what i like and. and you know people like my work and then also making my dogs really tired of them and. okay. thank you bye. that was funny. yeah. and then just do this.,0,0,2,0.8213218,0.17867824,,,,,478
37,166,okay. chat look like straight up there or are look at the screen. okay. okay alright okay thank you. yes. i'm doing okay. i'm from los angeles california. the food the weather in the people. i don't know it's not too many things i really don't like about la maybe some of the bad people or some of the bad environments in la. i'm sure you can. no not too much. i only been like to texas las vegas and that's pretty much it. catching a airplane to houston texas like back and forth to visit my dad and going to las vegas that are. oh yeah well when i was younger i used to go visit my daddy cuz he used to live in houston texas and i used to catch the airplane a lot and that was a lot of fun i wasn't scared that was a lot of fun and i enjoyed that. when i went to school i study child development and nursing. i know i wanted to be somebody and when i went to school i wasn't sure what i wanted to be so i kind of took nursing the lvn program first and then i didn't want to be a nurse so i changed my major to child development and i graduated from that. no i'm actually looking for work i'm unemployed right now. my dream job will be probably doing something working with the kids opening up a nursery or something my own business. in my mind is simple but like in reality it seem like it's kind of difficult. sometimes i'm shy but i'm really an outgoing person i'm a people person. to relax i listen to some slow music. kind of like have a quiet environment and maybe lay down and watch a little tv or something. i'm very good at controlling my temper i don't like to get really angry or upset or get to where i'm going to hurt somebody. when i really have arguments there like because people don't agree to disagree and if it's like really petty it's like we might say it's just like my opinion and they don't agree with my opinion so we argue about that but it's like nothing really big or anything like that just stupid i don't even remember. when you feel guilty about. probably not working right now i need a job. yes. maybe. i don't really remember a situation i've tried to really think before i really handle a situation and i try to handle it in a my best positive way before i really do something i regret. being with somebody like a guy you know if i want to continue a relationship with them or just be single. my relationship with my family i don't have. i just really stay with my dad and i have a daughter and we just stay close all my family there either in houston texas or they're around but i don't really socialized with a lot of my family. my dad. because i live with him right now i've been staying with him maybe about 5 to 6 years and. he's just the only one i really look up to i don't really have nobody else around me to really look up to and. that's it. she's in a fifth grade she's graduating she's going to the 6th grade and i'm kind of excited for that. you find it easy to be a parent. sometimes is easy but sometimes it gets a little overwhelming. the hardest thing about being a parent is being a single parent. it's just you always have to have somebody to bring you joy i enjoy always doing things with my daughter is just about making a lot of sacrifices and just always is brings me so much joy being a parent. well my parents when i was younger they lived apart so my mom. i don't know i'm i'm a much better parent cuz i'm more interested about what my child wants to do i'm involved in her life her every step just i'm really fully in my parents wasn't really that involved you know they had a drug problem so it just at the mature a lot faster than a lot of other kids. so. it was. just. my parents and. their drug addiction i wish i could erase that from my memory. now i cope with them well but when i was growing up it just was rough it was very rough had to do a lot of things on my own they wasn't involved in my decisions in life you know i just i didn't know how to really grow up and be a kid and which way to go or anything is just was like i was in the world by myself. yeah. all is very easy asleep will every night i couldn't sleep anytime i sleep very well. a little sad but most of the time i'm very happy i'm just not happy with where i am in my life right now. not really i really i try to think very positive and try to do whatever i can every day to look for work and just stay positive and focused. no i haven't. no i haven't. the last time i feel very happy was when i graduated from college i feel very happy that was one of the best things that happened in my life and that was the last time i was really really very happy like that. i feel like i was on top of the world i feel like. just overwhelmed with joy just everything was just so exciting for me that day i was just very very happy nothing can make me upset that day i was very happy and when i think about that day it is it's a very happy experience for me. right now i don't really have a best friend i really tried to. i tried to eliminate a lot of my friends because they wasn't really making a lot of positive choices so right now i'm just like i really don't have any friends right now. my personality i'm a happy person i'm an outgoing person and a positive person and a good mother. insecurities like sometimes i feel like. i have a lot of weight on my shoulders or something i feel like i can't get through something i can't get to the next step sometimes or just feeling down sometimes. well i did have a friend and she was like bipolar and i tried to really be your friend no matter the disease she had but she was in a really good friend because she one day she start this being very negative and just talking about me like we were enemies and everything and it didn't really make me feel too bad about myself but it just made me pick my friends very wisely. yeah just being friends with turn people that don't have positive things going on with themselves or just don't it just when i notice things about people that should determine whether i want to be there friend or not you know they might have bad qualities or just some bad habits they my smoke cigarettes or drink and i should notice that that's a red flag and i shouldn't be these people friends. to stay in school stay positive stay focused and surround myself with good positive people and just stay on the right track. well i went. to a friend's house that i haven't seen since childhood and they. is it a lot of people over there and they had a barbecue and everything and i really enjoyed seeing my old friends that are then seeing a long time and just being with my family and certain friends i really enjoyed because i'm really always in the house i really don't go out that often so just i enjoyed being with a group of friends and family and having a good time yeah. i'm proud that i did get my ged i did graduate and i do want to be somebody and i'm very proud that i want to be a better parent than my parents. thanks for sharing. thank you goodbye. okay.,0,0,2,0.62521094,0.374789,,,,,470
38,167,where i am. try to see look like someone i know. no problem okay. okay alrighty. hi. are you okay. yes i'm okay. i'm good i'm a little tired but i'm good. michigan i'm from michigan. a long time ago. then i laugh. once twice a year. compared to a. cold very cold. because i wanted to pursue my acting career. how did you do. well it wasn't a hard decision it was just it was the weather it was the opportunity it was the options more options. the driving has been a pain in the butt not so easy. blesse. besides the weather. i like that. things are more convenient. i like some of the people here. that are actually from home but. yeah and i just i like i like that it's a little late back. that's about it. i don't like the traffic i don't like. the gang violence in certain areas and i don't like. i like. maybe that's that's all i don't like. i don't know you know i like i don't like that it's so far away from home i wish i wish la was kind of midwest i wish it wasn't so far from home. have a close relationship with my family it's a small immediate family is really small and we're closed my grandmother recently passed saw it some and adjustment right now but i'm close to my family. okay. i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot. well i can't see your shoes but i do travel often. i do travel yes. i'm getting there i like getting beer once i'm at the wherever i'm going i like to actually do the tourist thing get to know places and people. okay i will owe i went to i'm france few years ago well many years ago and a little town called carcassonne and was very. it was it was actually really fun but very much like a storybook as far as what i expected to seeing what i actually saw like what i remember that i really enjoyed was that at night when everybody closes up like there no windows in the buildings but they are the shutters that most places in the united states have inside of windows they have them outside of the window there's no glass so you just shut and it looks like everything is abandoned like the buildings are abandoned so pretty cool i like that. i'm borderline sometimes i'm shy sometimes i'm outgoing and depends on who and what the situation is. music i turn on music i walk. through the neighborhoods now. i'm pretty good at controlling my temper i'm not a hothead at all. oh it was annexed roommate and it was about my loyalty as a friend. can you tell me about the. yeah pretty much gif. i thought that because i wanted my rent what she agreed to pay that i was not being a good friend that i should just let her live for free. that wasn't going to happen. so you know the loyalty came with letting you stay anyway or letting her stay anyway even after she didn't pay me so that's a friend i could have kicked her out i didn't. she laughed at the agreed time after she let me know that she was not going to pay but she could have. could have been a bad situation but there was an argument there a real a real one. i wish i had handled that situation differently and follow my first mind when we agreed to be roommates temporarily and gotten my money up front that's what i wish i had done and i just i didn't my mind told me to go along with it. no my my told me to get the money up front but i didn't. so. the hardest decision. i think i have yet to make the hardest decision but so far like. maybe leaving home. leaving home when i was years ago when i was like 18. yeah. i felt like i was abandoning my family that's what i felt. but i'm very encouraged me to go on and live my life. something that i could erase from my memory. probably a friend who i was on. dating i would like to erase from my memory how he responded to me when i told him my grandmother was ill. how is your day. i'm it's easy if i'm busy all day and i'm really really tired but actually my mind spins so. it's not that easy actually it's not that easy. i have to because i have to. be exhausted. i have to be exhausted. to be exhausted now it's not really hard you just do a lot of stuff all day long. irritable. up and down. i've been up and down like sometimes i've. then excited and anxious and on the other side i'm like. what am i doing. i need triggered by something. you're just a nature sister want to make some things happen. some goals. getting certain kind of work and. having a certain amount of income and. just taking care of myself do you know the way i think i should take care of myself just the physical stuff. eating right and everything. yeah i have. can you tell me about. sometimes i have a lot of distracting thoughts that have nothing to do with what i need to be focused on in the moment and i'm conscious of that him like of all the things that keep popping up in my head why am i thinking about that. i let them happen and then i try to think about other things and faze it out pops back up i phase it out. i know. now. when the roommate moved out i was really happy when she finally left. tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. i'm probably reading and maybe go i'll go dancing that would be ideal i can go dancing salsa dancing and yeah. what are some things you wish you could change about your. my ability to make a decision quicker and to act on it. really badly. i don't know if i have a time to someone has ever made me feel really badly i don't feel bad about much. as courageous. i will be at in a nutshell. in general. i regret not making some different decisions when i was younger as far as moving forward as far as career stuff and relationship things i wish i had done some things earlier in my life that i'm doing now. i'm really going after some of my personal goals and. deciding to actually be in a relationship that's long-term and yeah i wish i had done that earlier. 20 years ago i would have given given myself the advice to continue with my schooling beyond what i did and. to be more discerning in my choices of individuals who i allow in my life. being a part of the family that i'm a part of. thank you. goodbye. i didn't know if it went.,0,0,2,0.8487687,0.15123129,,,,,401
39,184,virtuous. are you okay. yeah. i'm doing okay how are you doing. i'm originally from like a suburb of la from the san gabriel valley. i like the diversity i like the vibe of the city i've lived other places and just not. as happy here i feel like i can really thrive here so i just like la like all the things that are so close together and there's a lot of interesting things are totally different parts of the city 2 miles away from each other. don't like the traffic. like all the cars but i can live with it i mean there's not that much i don't like. aesthetic music vocal performance the study music technology things like that. yes. right now i sing an opera company but my i do have a day job because it doesn't pay that much unless you're actually working for the la opera so i do have a day job and work at a call center that caters mostly to performers and actors and things like that and it's really good because if i get a call i can call in and change my shift very easily actually pretty good gig. they do some technology gigs sometimes yes you do some recording some live sound stuff but i'm kind of want to get away from that do some video work sometimes but again i want to get away from that don't go back to the because i find that performing more is more interesting i like being talent where they like being crew. so i kind of want to get away from that side and start working more toward actually doing what i want to do with my life. okay. you consider yourself. sometimes mean repair my personal life yeah they do have a shell that i put out there to deal with people but if i'm at home rather just keep to myself or my husband or my cats or whatever talk to family don't really have too many close friends but yeah you know. i rather keep to myself. a moderately close to the family that i have laughed have actually lost a lot of family in the last 10 years or so but like thank you but like my gym clothes to my husband and and. i've got a couple of cousin i talk to you and my aunt that i have an aunt that i talk to you a bit but it's not like we're interacting everyday close together. but it's somewhat close. mostly i saying or i read or write or. hang out and try to clear my mind of all thoughts sometimes it doesn't work but they try to do that and try to. clear everything and see what starts coming back in and. sometimes a heart sometimes that doesn't but mostly creating things contacting my family through facebook or whatever works but. most of my free time i create things. i like to travel more i travel by car a lot new my idea of. like having a birthday celebration would be to go on a road trip and i like to travel more. i'd like to travel for work things or whatever but i don't get as much an opportunity as i would like to travel. sea of particulate driving my car seem like the landscape change seeing people change seeing you feeling the vibrations of the area change like just seeing what's out there and i know that there's a bigger world outside of. where i am and where i live in my world and like to see that. but i like to leave that to go back to my world. a trip i'd like to take us to make the drive from here to nevada weather i go all the way to vegas or just go to stateline. my cousin and i would take what we call exit one trip because once you get to the first exit of a highway you're either in another state or you're at the end of the highway so would take those we just sort of impromptu would like a day or two notice just move things around just take off so those are actually trips that i like make could take off and then just come back sometimes the same day sometimes overnight just small short trips that aren't very involved but you just get to go and you see things and see how the desert landscape looks in different seasons how people react in different times of the year in different areas. too close to home but not. but not close to home close to home but it was still a world away so that cuz i don't really have time to take like a two-week vacation or whatever little things that kind of put things back in perspective and clear my head think like that mean cuz there's sort of a sense of meditation and then that you get on a highway that you can get driving the freeway so i like doing that. the last time that happened was may of last year so i might be able to do that we actually my aunt came over with my cousin who is 10 years younger than i am and we kind of grew up like sisters and i was about to move away from the inland empire which is where they live so kind of took me on a last hurrah when we drove up to vegas and looked around and came back cuz i actually lived in vegas for a while but i don't like it so it's kind of a social to some of the locals sites around there and we came back and was an overnight trip but we are driving the entire time. it's kind of interesting. things are just inherently unfair when people are mean to the elderly or two children or the animals people who can't fight back and i mean to them just because they can't fight back. and. actually. like to see people who are. as strong as the people who are being mean standing up and being an advocate or what have you. so i think that's one thing this makes me really mad just being cruel or mean for no reason and i'm not good for people who can't fight back a few people who've done nothing to deserve it. that kind of really just makes me mad. okay. but i'm annoyed i'll try to just walk away from the situation and if the situations to start following me then i'll wind up lashing out somehow either. are verbally just. cutting them with a quipper you know really just i really will yell at somebody. but i'll try to if i try to walk away and diffuse it if that doesn't work they don't let them know that they're annoying me and get away from me. not like legal trouble or anything because usually i'll find a way to get them to leave me alone. there's not really like big trouble but cuz it cuz it's it is off-putting and it's not an expected reaction and that's actually kind of cultivated in me that it's not the expected reactions i know that will work and get people away from me so it's not really in trouble and if it's is trouble issues of trouble that is from mad that other person's perspective and doesn't affect me at all because do the situation i can get out of. so as long as they leave me alone and walk away from it. the last time i argued with somebody. hurt like a prayer like a family member or an outsider or somebody not. the last thing i could think of was. a argued with my husband about the care of my mother-in-law cuz she's got dementia and so we were the reason we came out here from the inland empire with take care of her she won't go anywhere but la and she is like hardcore angelino like we know we are that wear that in our nature but we also know it's cheaper to live elsewhere but so we came out here to take care of her. and he wants her to be able to stay in her in her apartment and i want her to move in with us because it would be cheaper and faster and easier and safer for her if she lived with us but she wants to stay where she is cuz she can't see that there's inherent danger now because of the disease process but he wants her to stay where she he wants her to be able to have what you want cuz he's a mama's boy like i am i'm a mama's girl you know i lost my mom like four years ago i'm still a mama's girl and i'll standing still and i know that it brings you a sense of satisfaction to carry out their wishes because you care about them so much that's what they wants you want to get it for him and because you don't they you know that happened when you were going up with me try to give you what you want because you wanted it and you want to do that for them now they started giving back to them somebody that you care about me you feel deserves it. but it's kind of dangerous for you know i don't want this thing to happen to her yet i want her to remain who she is for as long as you can so i know it seems that she has is going to erase who she is eventually and eventually she will have to be put in a place where they can give a 24-hour medically trained care but until then we can we can handle it you know amongst ourselves it's not that bad but it's getting where she really should has no business living by herself anymore so the solution right now is he stays there most of time with her and i go back to our house and it gets stressful and it gets annoying because it's i do i handle the outside things are run the errand to take her to the store things like that he does the day-to-day things make sure she has she eats make sure she has clean clothes things like that. so me it's a partnership it to its. a dual effort is very much to do effort but i would like her to move in with us so that was that's like. a source of not really like yelling screaming argument but lively discussion and debate. not insurmountable mean life's not going to be easy ever and if it is at when you should worry because that's when somebody can pull the rug out from under you so as long as you're on top of things in your present your life is not going to be easy you deal with it and move on. the most positive influence to think i've been probably my mother and my grandmother cuz my mom was pretty much a single mom and my grandmother helped raise me and they actually. gave me a lot of confidence and but we're realistic about it. i mean i think i have sort of a. realistic serve a downer temperament to myself that they that they helped me see that it's just in me and it's not something i can't get over and that you know life's going to go on and my mom would say to me when you're forty or fourty whether you working at mcdonald's or doing what you want with your life i think that was a big influence and how it with i was like my life since she has passed. i regret not taking care of myself in the last year my mother's life because i think i may have clouded some of my decisions know it do have underlying conditions everyone in my family is diabetic i didn't take care of that when she was the last year for life because i was too busy wanting to get her home my focus was to get her home so i didn't eat ride i didn't take my insulin right on my wanted making myself insulin resistant that that you're just because my blood sugar was so high for a like a year eating just horrible foods when i did eat so it really took it really actually made myself very sick and i'm wondering well if i didn't if i would have taken care of myself and i had my head on completely straighten my my vision in my thoughts weren't complete run clouded. what i made some better decisions on her behalf especially when she needed them when she needed me to be to step in and make this is for because she wound up having a health catastrophe she had kidney we said can you damage i want to be kidney failure and her health insurance provider miss that so she wanted having sort of this hole. catastrophe where everything at once just started breaking down she wanted having a stroke at like 51 small stroke and it just kind of went down from there something while if i didn't if i had taken care of better care of myself but i've been able to take better care of her. i know there wasn't anything i would have been able to do to prevent her death what i say if i what i've been able to make it easier on her. if i would have taken care of myself that's like one huge regret that i have. oh i know i am but it's my desire to take responsibility for everyone and everything that i care about taking responsibility for my own life and me and mine and i know other people i can't really direct them into my own vision because they're their own. individual beings. and they can't you know be what i want them to be and i know they're not going to be. but i still have you know my ideals and i want the way i want everything to go and i want everybody that i care about to be happy and to be able to. fit into my life in a way in the best way possible but i know there are other beings and i'm not going to be able to do that for them then i can build you up for me but it still buy ideals so i have to sometimes have to look at it going well is this what i want because i want it or what is what they want and what's their is their decision or mine and she's it's theirs i know it's there so if you really care about somebody you're just going to support them and go with them but. it still. kind of hard for me and i know i got to get over it. 10 or 20 years ago. probably to have been more assertive and starting my own life because i want up taking care of my mother mean she got sick literally the weekend i graduated from college and had a job lined up and had to pull out of that because she needed me to take care of her i think would have been more aggressive about starting my own life getting a job outside the house in addition to caring for her getting my own job history of my own credit history thing like to think like that built up instead of becoming just totally her daughter for about 10 years. so i figured i probably would have done that. potomac do that and keep who you are and learn to separate. you're who you are and what you feel you need to be doing for your family to keep a sense of yourself that's probably what i would have induced things for yourself to keep that you sent of yourself that's probably what are we giving myself 10 years ago. no. no. i know but probably cuz i haven't gone to a doctor about it cuz i don't want to know. i mean it's not i know there were times in my life where i've been severely depressed and usually circumstances and had to pull myself out of it but i'd rather pull myself out of it for resorting to treatment. after my mother had died may have been this long battle for a year that we lost and i didn't know. if i if i was to blame for that it's like logically knew i wasn't but. how can i convince myself of that. two weeks after she died i want up with. pulmonary embolisms in one in each long because i didn't take care of myself for year that they are all i'm 30 years old if you know whatever i do myself i can get over no turned out but i want up having to take more medication because of that it's been a fight to get my own house back to get to be able to get out of that depression cuz so much of my life was based on being my mother's daughter office and i didn't like. the rug was pulled out my like button fell into my world after that so that was the pretty pretty much sent me into a deep depression i'm i almost got divorced because of bad because i didn't want anything anymore so i know his ex being really distant from my husband by then at that time we were married for about two years at that point i started getting very distant from him pushing everything away.. and feel what am i going to do with the rest of my life now. and. ben. a fight and then you be there times and no i couldn't get up. stay in bed and sleep all day but then realizing that. when my mother died i had forecast like after 2 or mine to rehearse so i went up adopting the two that were hers because they don't have a choice of whether they can go out and get their own food and get their own you want to play. i took that responsibility of doing it for them. so that was one motivating factor was that they didn't have a choice of whether or not i was going to get up and provide for them i mean i could go without eating i could go that taken care of myself but they couldn't they didn't nail so they are they actually got me up and. and they made me go out and face things even though didn't want to ditch didn't just kind of want to curl up and die but that would have been my choice not theirs and they i mean what would happen to them if i was there to take care of them they would have been sent to a shelter or whatever probably and maybe they would have not been re-adopt me home and adopted by somebody else maybe they would have been killed for for me meaning for me making a selfish decisions so it's like i need somebody to take care of to get myself a bit. nuts acumen a motivating factor is cuz i figured out that it was just me i'd be able to live without a lot of stuff in my car if i wanted it wouldn't be big deal i wouldn't care as long as i was doing what i wanted with my life but. i have a family to look after now so i have to go out and do things and i have to go out and look for legitimate work you know dating your day job have to let you know but i'm trying to strike a balance between the two because his what i want to do with my wife but yet i have to take care of my family some homework on a balance of the two. very but it's worth it i mean. it would be very i have a lot less things to worry about if i just looked at my car and said forget it. but keeping a residence down paying bills things like that. it's difficult but you have to do it if you want you want any if you ever want anything in your life you have to go through that. i am and i know that but it gets hard sometimes you do want to give up but then it's like wall what's the alternative. i mean i don't think i can live a comfortable life. if i did i wouldn't do anything i have to be slightly uncomfortable or am i going to do anything with myself i'm just going to be content just hang out all day stay in bed hang out with mike catherwood ever. and it wouldn't get anything done. a very anxious and nervous and mean what if. i don't find. enough you went off work to be able to pay my rent or whatever what if. yo what what if i can't. keep. a semblance of stability in my life and it's actually hard work to be stabled and i know it's hard work to be stable but. what's answers a lot of what-ifs and anything it's things that haven't happened and it's stupid and pointless to worry about things that haven't happened and i know that but it's still have it still protects that's actually. a source of. anxiety. anxiety go by getting things done figuring things out making a solid plan and going for it. but i know it is a cycle and i'll go from being really anxious and oh my god what am i going to do what am i going to do the same okay what is. the fundamental thing i need to take care of here. me when what is just extraneous and what can what is what are the actual not issues and what is the actual issue and so figure figure things out that way and then things i t shirt to go with a little bit but then something will pop up in the what if so come up again i'll have to. figure it out again but i know it's a cycle i know what seems huge on the surface when you start chipping away at it you get over it pretty quickly get through it. the last time i felt really happy. i don't know. huh could question like that actually surprisingly stumped me because i do feel happy sometimes sometimes not so much as i just cannae and the middle. really like over joyously happy i don't know. if not i can't think of when that happened. i don't know you don't know perceptions of other people mean. probably a somebody who. oddly enough somebody who is laid-back and. handle things as they come but i don't see myself as at at all. as it is. probably that i can think on my feet and i'm not afraid to. hustle my butt off and do whatever i have to do to survive and get things done. that. and i can do it creatively and i try to. strive for balance. play the best things about me. then i'm doing basically what i want with my life which even though it's not all easy it's not. i am not financially well-off or anything it's still a lot more than a lot of people can say about their lives cuz i have an aunt that i really don't talk to who and the reason why i don't talk to her because she's always miserable mean she's got a career that she. it's more of a job that she fell into cuz my older aunt loves animals but didn't want to be a veterinarian so she became a dog groomer and she was actually really good at it she had a stable business for a long time. but her know she tried to get arthritis in her hands and she had that should my cousin's father went and cut a. stole all the money for her business so she lost your business and she kind of it she retired early cuz between that and that's why does she want to retiring early she employed my younger aunt who is still a dog groomer but she hates it and it's like change your life if you hate your life so much change it. and i think the thing i'm most proud of is. yeah i'm not as financially well-off as she is but i'm doing what i want with my life you know i can be creative i can have creative people around me people who actually like to talk to around me people actually like in my life and be happy with that and they see a lot of people who aren't and then it gives me a sense of maybe a bloated sense of southside tracking to be able to say i'm not like that that i'm actually doing what i want even though their sacrifices i'm still fundamentally doing what i want with my life now. thank you. thank you goodbye.,1,0,2,0.83806926,0.16193077,,,,,337
40,187,"how to start up a virtual human and she's going to chat with you for a bit. okay. thank you. yes. i'm okay. hey los angeles. there's a lot of things to do i love the beach i love the i love it sunny all the time. i'm the amount of people. that's really about it behind of people. just a little. i just like going to new places and just discovering new things. i recently went to new york i was there for about three months and it was extremely boring i went to western new york and it was extremely a snowy and it was an imposition why i didn't have a car so i can get to go very many places and i was in a small town so i. it was beautiful for what i got to see but really it wasn't really much to it. yeah. both i'm both an introvert and an extrovert. i really enjoy doing things for myself i have a lot of my own up my likes and dislikes and i spend a lot of time alone even though i had you have a lot of friends and when i do go out i i do tend to meet a lot of people but i also enjoy being by myself a lot. probably outgoing creative. talented fun trustworthy. i studied language and physics and. math. no i'm not i'm actually i'm up i'm trying to be an actress. i was something that i fell into when i was a teenager. and i really enjoyed doing it i hadn't done it for years so i figured why not i just came back to california to might as well try something that i did enjoy really doing. are you happy. so far i just got picked up by an agent so i haven't really done anything yet as an adult. i'm hoping hoping something it'll be fruitful. i really don't have and have too many. i guess my sister she's done really well. my boyfriend he's a. he's a very positive human being but really i haven't had too many positive influences. i'm close i mean we hang out i don't tell them everything they're kind of judgmental but other than that i mean i mean we hang out i mean i see them everyday. cheese. it's kind of hard for me to relax, try to watch tv and i read a lot. tell me about it i read i do a lot of sleeping i'm a little depressed so yeah it's kind of like i said it's really hard for me to relax. it isn't i tend to think a lot about things that stress me out been through a lot of a lot of stuff so i. yes i i don't i don't i don't sleep very well tonight and if i do fall asleep i wake up other than i usually with some kind of anxiety attacks. i dream a lot about the stuff that has a has affected me throughout the years so. usually unocal dream about something that stressed me out and then i'll wake up and make my chest to hurt or just i just can't sleep all night because i just think it seemed to be i don't know if i'm afraid to go to sleep but i. i just i don't know i feel like they've got the vulnerable place for me because of stuff that have happened to me so. so i sleeping is just not really something i do well. tired i'm in a moody is very sensitive. yeah i'm just not a negative person which really that's not me. yeah i'm judgemental is not me either i just i'm just not a not a nice person to be around. i tried i spent a lot of my time reading i try to go out and do i force myself to go out and do things just to keep myself involved so that i don't just sit around in the end and dwell on the fact that i can't sleep and i try to get myself is exhausted as i possibly can buy running around and doing things. it's difficult i do like there is a part of me that doesn't want to i don't really want to go out and do things i have to actually force myself to if i have make appointment i got i make appointments just like for auditions or leaving to do this i am i attend to. just not like at the last minute i'll try to convince myself not to go but then i force myself to you anyways. i've been diagnosed for two instances i was diagnosed about three years three and a half years ago and then i was diagnosed again in august. the first time it was. i just wasn't because of the not sleeping and leah justice of the unbelievable stress and then the second time it was going to start with the not sleeping and then every moment of the day was just thinking about what happened to me. and i just like i just couldn't take it anymore so i figured i was getting too gloomy i was getting i come. not thinking life was worth it and i guess i just needed to see somebody before anyting escalated. yeah it was. find i do not. one of the reasons i went to new york was to try to get out of my environment and i'm not seem to help a lot and i'm out here i i was i just the counselors that i was going to just didn't really seem to be helping me much they just they just seem to be giving me a lot of medication and i don't believe that that's what i needed yeah so stressed lately i've been really sad and i don't know why. but like i said i've been trying to combat that by keeping myself busy. actually i'm kind of a couple days ago. i was actually really happen it was genuinely happy but then i went back to being you going back to feeling miserable. i realized. i got up in the morning i actually did get a good night of sleep and. i realized that i'm actually really lucky. cuz i've been through a lot in my life and i have somebody in my life who really loves me and somebody who is finally there for me and. you know gives me what i need emotionally and i was just really thankful for by and that made me really happy. yeah. thank you. oggi's. i've had so many years of just. just bad there's a lot of bad that there has been a long time since i've been proud of anything i guess if anything it's my ability to survive through all the hardships i've been through. a lesser person i guess would have gotten rid of themselves a long time ago but even though like i'm really depressed and i feel gloomy and i just feel miserable about a lot of things there's got to be a silver lining. so. so yeah so me and like i guess that's what i'm proud of that. although whole bunch of bad things happen to me and hasn't ruined me i still try to be a good person and try not to be negative towards other people and. untruthful and i still i still have drive-in me. huh so much. i lost marriage. i'm not getting out when i should have. panda just. i regret a lot. the any situation that would have had a red flag. just get out of it you know some things just don't work and. no matter how hard you try no matter how much you put into it so i i i would tell myself to. it's not selfish to let go of a bad situation and not everybody can be helped so sometimes you just got to live for yourself and help yourself so i know not done had i known that then i i i probably would have done better in life. people who. when people are down on me for my faults that i have done that i have things that i've done in my past that people steal still relive when i'm trying to forgive myself people who are mean to other people people who talk poorly about people behind their backs people that are untrustworthy. just anybody who pick some a little guy you know people who don't care about the environment or animals. i just i think that everybody should be as good as i possibly can be and it's it's disheartening and it just makes me so mad that people just can't be people don't let people live people try to make everybody feel is negative and it's partly if they do and that makes me mad. event july 10th event and then. and then and then it's usually over i try not to bad-mouth people. i try to just talk through it until until it's gone and then it doesn't bother me anymore. i tried not to get angry because i have a really bad temper and did. and i can get out of hand so what i do is i i have something gets me so mad i tend to go and take a nap i'm not in that situation where i can just go and i usually just walk away from the situation and i try to clear my mind and come back to it. it was a couple days ago it was actually my mother it was about. actually she thought that i had taken a shirt from her and she was screaming and yelling at me and i was i was tired of my was it was late and i started to yell back at her unit because i was hurt that she would accuse me of something so petty. any. it's a going back to my past you know when i was younger in and i didn't care about you know people's things and i would just kind of take and do whatever i wanted to and i'm not so far from that person and it hurt me so i got mad and i think i started to yell and argue. kind of petty and stupid but at the time it seemed seemed viable. my most memorable experiences. i've had so many. maybe. it was. i don't know. it was. probably graduating pharmacy school. i felt pretty great i didn't know if i was doing very very well or not and i ended up getting like on my last test scores i get end up getting like 98% and. i actually i did had no confidence that i had done it well it and class in school at all and i i didn't even know i was getting the grades i was getting so that was a really big accomplishment for me. and yeah that was great it was a great memory. unreliable. i am. i'm talented i. i'm a good listener i'm always there to help people i tend to always try to do the right thing. sometimes i actually forget that i have any good qualities but. i'm just. i am around that try to be you know his is good in the best person that i can meet other people and myself. gwen, shows. just them. having moments where you just laugh with people. sometimes just rating puts me in a good mood. play that's about it. thank you.",1,0,2,0.7198328,0.28016725,,,,,346
41,190,i was just wondering if she doesn't look like anything like the actual yeah like a virtual reality thing yeah. k. okay k. okay when i'm done okay. and please. are you okay with this. pretty good. new york. i moved to la in the 70s. but i asked you what i lived a lot of different places. i guess every few years but i travel a lot so i've lived in i've lived in africa is lyft in spain switzerland hong kong 2. what do you enjoy about. different cultures food music rituals of everything the smells of colors makes you feel alive. excuse me. one of my trips. i lived in kenya for about a year i'd say i love horseback riding so when you're viewing other animals when you're kind of disguise in the scent of a horseshoe can approach the animals a lot closer so it was great seeing red orange ball sunsets and riding along you know seeing somebody animals yeah. in kenya. probably when i went to a. messiah village and i happen to i used to live in hawaii and i had been to tahiti and i was wearing one of those perils that are hand-painted and i had it tied over the left shoulder with the twisted one or not and i happen to enter a maasai village for the first time that day and i looked all around in the men were wearing their clothing exactly what the same twist on the same shoulder and they came over to me and they said why are you dressed maasai and. and then they came back and gave me what appear to be some very large what looks like beaded leather bookmarks but they were actually earrings and they would have liked wade my ears straight down and and then gave me some bracelets and then they had me wear something around my waist in the city now you look proper maasai. so but i i just i have a lot of fun i think living getting a chance to live in different countries around the world i'm just you feel alive all your senses are completely you know i woken yeah. i think it's not so clear-cut i think a lot of people's are a hybrid of both i mean i think i can be extremely shy sometimes but extremely brazen and very courageous and other times probably one of my best virtues is i'm very gutsy person so when i really feel passionate about something i risk everything to go achieve it sometimes i believe that. usually will i make decisions very quickly and i find that i have a friend who makes decisions very slowly and he said to me tell me how i can make decisions quicker and i told him i said well and that you should case you always have no choice in this is what do you mean there's hundreds of choices and i said not really because it's got wise is only one and it doesn't really matter you waste time physical energy emotional energy mental energy reflecting all of it when i get why she always know what the choice were you really want to do is and it doesn't matter whether there's a 98% chance of failure even if it's a 2% chance of success you have to go to the one that may yield your joy so i always go to that ass tits to me a waste of total time and energy to even think about another choice cuz who cares if you remain unscathed but it wouldn't yield to no joy. sometimes when i'm feeling 10 i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not. departed. you said you put your fish. what do i do when i'm annoyed. i don't want to annoy sometimes like it's because sometimes i can have like it needs to be a little more patient. i guess you really have to put yourself. and somebody else's shoes rather than the way you would react you have to have more empathy. how hard is it. not really i think that's the reason why i enjoy traveling so much cuz you're putting other situations where you're forced to to understand other people's lives a lot more regardless of how different they are from your s different situations i've been to so many third world countries and lived in so many different situations that helps create that which is why travel is really the best education there is. when was the last time. my sink. last time i argued about something. go try to remember. oh is he goes when somebody didn't respect actually my privacy and something. oh i know what it was. it was somebody who belong to the. scientology face. i inherited. i inherited possibly of a immune disorder from my mother my mother died from lupus and i sometimes even right now i had like skin rashes welts and everything and i am very photos sensitive and. i had an you know what episode where was i had a big flare up and i wasn't really feeling well i felt flushed and everything and the scientologists tells me that i needed to be audited and and he said something about are you aware of past lives and i had told him that i was buddhist and i was kind of curious that if you're going to try to recruit somebody to convert to your religion at least you should find out the other person what religion they are just to even be informed be able to talk to them and he said that are you aware of that about something in your past and i go yes i believe that many religions including buddhism's and scientology believe that things that you have. had in your history sometimes a statue or things that you keep that anger issues bitterness resulting from even your past relationships or your parents can affect and make you even sick make you even have cancer yes we believe that and we also believe i said that you know that you had the power of each person as a god-like or buddha like nature to go ahead and you can make yourself even when i'm on the verge possibly and i probably get one cold maybe every 15 years i don't have a tendency to be sick at all and a large part of it as i think when i think i'm on the verge i take the sort of like and i did this even when i was a child when i was seven i would fall down i have my boo boo and i would say i would say i would have two good part. you know help the bad part of a simplistic way in terms of a child and i would actually even when i was in a very severe car accident where i got cut by glass my whole back i contradict healing an enzyme when i went back to the hospital the doctors actually had the nurses come and say this is incredible that she has hers last week or back was so severely cut this is incredible healing thing so i believe that but. but i was just i think i'm annoyed and irritated because the scientologists told me that because he had taken 20 or 40 courses and he had the certificates on his wall that he felt that he was more enlightened and it wasn't even matter i said of whether he was really took 20 40 courses of whether i've been practicing buddhism whether it was for 5 10 15 20 years of weather of somebody been practicing some type of christianity for 50 years and benny sitting in a church pew every day doesn't mean a person could have never attended church and be more spiritual than somebody who has you know so i just was thinking that is the antithesis of. somebody who says they were lighting but it's just the way i guess he kept grabbing his. you know his face down my throat that after while i was pretty patient with a but then who it was so papa's that i became irritated. especially when he kept telling me that i was audited and yet the same person needed a hip surgery the following week and i didn't point it out him cuz i just didn't want to get into it but one could say hey you have a bad hip cuz you need to be audited that that something that you did in your past otherwise you wouldn't need to get hip surgery i mean i believe to some extent things that can be caused by people themselves and then he flippantly said while you wear a scientologist believe that past lives can also affect you know what i'm thinking to myself buddhist of all religions. kind of like well known for being believing in in a cause and effect and past life situations and i found my thought you should really read up if he's trying to convert other people from other religions so but you know i die you know i i i just didn't you no care for the fact that he wouldn't drop it. but other than that i mean i don't. sometimes to have a little more tact i guess when when in terms of patients. i can think of that right away i guess disconnecting my father when he was like a vegetable in the hospital. i'm sorry. how did you do. my brother was supposed to be the strong and supposedly because he is in the medical field so my sister and i said well you know he's a medical one so he's probably used to seeing this all the time but it turns out he was the weakest one and even after you know my boss my father kept me know you know bucking these body would actually be fighting the artificial respirator and what kind of things you see all this jerking of body movements and stuff it was just very hard but you know i was after while the. you know even the physicians and even the pastor from that particular you know hospital they said that he was no longer like even if he was to awaken from that he did his brain function would have been you know legible. that was. tell me about nevada. i don't think i really have that many things that are that traumatic that happened to me that i've. had to block them i really don't know what it is within my makeup which. doesn't make me feel like i need to like i don't keep the i have friends that have on mitigated issues which they're not even aware of that affect their behavior or maybe their bitterness or their anger their hatred or their fear and for some reason i feel blessed that i don't have to like i can't really even think of something that i mean i've had some bad situations happen to me but it's not that the some reason they traumatized me in effecting you know my behavior where i would wear i block at that i'm not aware of something or i hold residual negativity for some reason so i really can't think of anything i mean does bad things that happen i know that they are but it's not like i feel like a necessary for me to block them because i've been able to. you know. chaps that sometimes they were unfortunate things that happened. pretty easy i can usually make my sleep by self sleep in any situation if i have a 1 hour flight to san francisco i could just kind of lean against the window where the pillow have a blanket over and even on our flight pass out before the plane is even taking off from the ground so i can i have literally when i've had little sleep and i very at high energy so i don't really need that much sleep but say like if i'm in africa and i. bobby potholes unpaved road and i still need side i need a few moments of sleep i was just prop something up put my elbow against the window and say i think i should take a nap for 15 minutes go like this and through the jostling i could just take a nap for 15 minutes so i don't really have that problem. okay pretty okay me and i could deal without the skin flare-ups but you know from the photosensitivity and all that but other than that i'm pretty good spirits. have i ever studied what. i can still couldn't hear you i'm sorry. have you noticed any changes in your. i've ever studied changes in my behavior was the word. enough. i know i just with friends and everything just even this past week just seeing friends that i enjoy being with and just having great meal laughing just having a good time listening music. designing your address. regret about my entire life you man or are you talking about just recently or what are you talkin about. you know what's funny i find that lot of the negative experiences that are in my life that have happened are falsely been. opens up experiences that are. that are also great that i have not overlooked root sample i got totally ripped off by my business partner to the tune of my old my whole savings ever had to start all over again and sometimes people say to me like are you sure you're okay or are you just pretending to be okay or are you angry do you want to seek revenge if i was there cuz my business partner essentially ripped me off we knew each other's families which was even more difficult in a way and he still essentially my whole life savings essentially in a way and tea what got sent to prison or the fbi was involved in her pulse involved i was living in switzerland and my father was sick and i was going back and forth and. but you know if i hadn't get involved hadn't gotten involved with him and business i wouldn't have had there a lot of rich experiences and i think sometimes the reason why. i don't know why i'm such a positive person but for some reason i'm able to this not that i'm purposely trying to i do see the positive this and even harmful situations i wouldn't have gotten to live in barcelona and zurich i wouldn't have learned to speak as good spanish drummond lived in in europe if i had not got involved in business with my business partner end up ripping me off but and there's a lot of other experiences a different friendships that i developed during that. of time and in a way it was a total different life a different world that that would do you know that i would have never. have the chance you know to live through if i had not been filed in my ear but of course it cost me financially and but then again i've always been a type of person who your money isn't everything and i think the one i least cared about money is when i made the most of it so there you go and resemble one of my favorite. times in my life probably when i lived in kenya and you would think that you know a lot of people have this really bad vision or maybe looking living in mud dong huts or something and living very primitively i mean it's not like that at all that i and you think that with the least amount of technological innovations and stuff like that i mean actually and i'd really didn't have you know that much been many material goods to the time i mean i had the blast i had probably been one of the best years of my life when i was living in kenya. that's so good to hear. what advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago. the same thing that i did probably when i was about 15 or 16. to live your life with passion and again like shoes the way i was saying earlier about making decisions you have to make those decisions. wise what will give you a sense of on wonderment what will make you give you joy and you have to its regardless what the percentage are even if you only have a 1% chance of success you have to go to sad cuz that's the only thing that will yield you know the happiness in your life. otterbein your life. the fact that i've a two-year to that and been brazen whatever you want to say have the balls of cuts / like a harness to go ahead and follow my passions and you know i guess people called me somebody strong decisions usually this isn't sorry when you where you remain unscathed usually don't heal joy that's just murphy's law office just the way it is. okay i think i've asked everything i need to thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. hi.,0,0,2,0.78727764,0.21272233,,,,,411
42,204,sure. good i guess. new orleans louisiana. a 2005. i used to go back often but not much anymore. just think happened. well i guess you're not programmed with trina happened in 2005. not really. tell me about that. where to begin just has different culturally have a different culture out here it's just a different place. it's it's bike-friendly. louisiana isn't new orleans for that matter really isn't now they're trying to be but it just it isn't that successful. the drivers the crazy. not really kind of but not much anymore. don't have the money kind of broke. just being able to go on an adventure. i once went to comic-con on a on a bicycle like on a 3-wheel bike. and that was pretty fun kind of scary and dangerous new i got killed it was scary. traveling or just in general. i got to say. i got to say we were we were heading out of. we were getting off the pch and going into. laguna i'm going to have this really steep hill and on sundays it's full of traffic. and i remember going down. that the hill and my brakes weren't working and i was trying to hit my brakes and try and hit my brakes and they just they wouldn't quick and i was like oh god and i'm going to throw you all bikes on larger than most bikes and i'm like zipping in between like gridlock traffic going downhill. unable to break. and i'm going down. and suddenly there's the car that veers right into the century where i'm trying to go so i turn sharply. in front of between this bus and this truck and literally end up going sideways through traffic through oncoming traffic. looping back through oncoming traffic back into the right traffic still without any breaks and like not managing to keep my bike from. rolling which is painful when your bike rolls kind of hurts a lot. so yeah. noted. various different things at anthropologie visual effects. kind of weird but yeah. i've always had a fascination with film and. i think the white people do things and go about things as fascinating. just as like that the mob mentality of people. especially. dream job. huh i have no idea. did the job i guess. i consider myself more outgoing. you know i've never been afraid of what people think of me. why people don't like people i don't know. i'm not i'm not afraid of what they think. i'm more concerned with like the people i know and what they think of me i guess so being outgoing just doesn't really affect me. play video games listen to music. yeah read books i like reading books and drawing reading books drawing playing video games. did i forget anything sleeping. i like sleeping that's fine. not good. and high school a i shove somebody's head through a locker. yeah. yeah that that's not good don't ever shut someone's head into a locker that's a great way to get suspended. i don't know. things like that just getting into fights. like a serious argument. i guess like. argument over. over. i guess over like a like viewpoints on like that control and gun control laws. i mean. i was like yesterday evening. it was. it was an argument about you know gun control regulation i mean it doesn't really affect me personally but that was like the last argument i got into i want you specified i think. my entire life. i have. about two years ago i broke up with like as everyone calls her my evil acts. and. yeah it was just it was bad the whole the whole thing went down bad i mean. i think i've calmed down a lot since then. what is a person as a whole but i mean i was angry and stuff i think i like one riding my bike for like a hundred plus miles in a senior day and i was in a ton of pain like later in the evening i got home i was like oh god like i can barely walk. and yeah i think running off in like going on like extreme cycling spree was not good but is better than like. eating too much in like just over eating cuz i was depressed but yeah like we we fought and screamed and it was it was not good like i wasn't physically fight it was more like a screaming match of death. i don't think i've had a singular hard decision i've ever had to make because. my my biggest thing. and why don't you know don't regret. don't regret the things you do. just regret the opportunities you've messed and that's like had to come with me that's like hats i've had to like learn that in the past like 2 years. like two years ago i totally just cannot grasp that concept and answer your question i think thinking about it the hardest decision i've had to make is. i'd say. probably. probably to break up with my ex probably. where do i begin. my ex was not a good person and just in any way shape or form of the word. she did some things they wasn't entirely comfortable with. just took that the people around her and to me. i. you know they say you're supposed to give forgive people. for making mistakes or doing things. and i just i think there's some things you can't forgive people for no matter how hard you try and i think there's something that wants done. but they can't be undone they just their through the way that they are. and i think i think after what she did. i like i just did things just fell apart after that it just to spite us trying. i just didn't work out i mean. i don't know i don't really want to talk about exactly what happened. emojis. oh man. erase for my memory or just erased from ever happening. huh i don't you know that's hard. katrina just the experience of katrina for starters. my ex i guess between those two it's it's going to hurt at that actually rather lean towards katrina cuz that was just that that was not. i mean i guess you don't exactly know about it but. in 2005. does giant storm hit. new orleans louisiana killed a whole bunch of people level the town. and i'm also at a friend's during the storm. i mean i'm kind of getting over it but it's still it's still there and i think. i don't know i mean. you can try and look at you can try your best to try and find something positive in that but there's just there's nothing the only thing you can do is just think that was like a freak accident will never happen again i live in la and you know. earthquakes can happen i just think i'd rather rather know that it's coming then not know it's coming. have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd. yes. yeah. depression it's record multiple times. that's no surprise first time i was diagnosed was in middle school. which would have been. ten well ten between 10-12 years ago i don't know i don't know whenever i was in the sixth grade that's my first was told that i was depressed. as far as ptsd goes. post-katrina. and then you know. post-katrina moster that was the big thing. i guess having been diagnosed previously is being depressed and still being in high school. it kind of wasn't i wasn't really seeking help its kind of i got that kind of got into my high school and then we're like here's help cuz we know you're going to need it. and i was like oh well thanks i didn't really ask for it but okay i'll take it. you know. just kind of happened. no not not anymore. what's a good question you know i was like i'm not going to do this anymore. sometimes. sometimes it's a lot of like how are you feeling today and stuff and. you know it's kind of well i'm feeling fine right now but. ask me in 2 hours and who knows you know. i guess. it's helped me understand that some of the things that just happened just happened and to just get on and move along with your life. essential just like carrion you know things will happen carry on. tell me about the last time you felt really happy. wow. i was. i was hanging out with my girlfriend just hanging out. for starters i mean you can't see when i walked in but i'm walking with cane right now cuz i got hit by a car recently and make my leg better. what's a chainsaw over there that way but anyway. i don't know i make myself less fat. how to make it so i don't feel the incessant need to sleep 14 hours a day. ohm kiss when you sleep like more than 10 hours a day it's just some productive if you waste too much time with guy friends who are like oh you know i feel rejuvenated after 6 hours and i'm like how do you do that i have to sleep with 12 hours to feel good when you can sleep 6 you know like in an crunch time you know you can get away with for i have to get away with seven or eight you know. like that that's my crunch time sleep schedule 8 hours it's just i don't know i oversleep but i like sleeping to. i'm just the oversleeping part i don't like so much. utterly insane in a good way i'd really insane in a good way i guess. like that they would also say like you know. that there are times where i might seem like an asshole and i'm not really an ass-whole i just you know. i just have issues like everybody else specifically i have asperger's so that's a form of autism. i'm not just kind of makes life awesome. did also say i'm flamboyant an eccentric cuz i totally am. i just. i don't know i figure i'm still alive so i should live because i'm still alive. do you know who knows how long i'm going to be live for so i should you know. live while i'm alive and just. go out and do stuff not. not sit and be calm. except when i'm reading. i like reading. stop fucking up know it's kind of messed up. i think i would have told myself at the time. because i have known my my evil acts i've known her since like i was like six and she was five i think 10 years ago i would have grabbed myself by the shoulders and say you see that girl whatever you do do not date that girl. don't trust her she can't be trusted and more importantly don't. don't let your guard down around her cuz show show exploit that. i don't mean like physically let your guard down not mentally. yeah don't date or just don't do it it's not worth it it's not worth the trouble it's not worth the pain. it's not worth it. the fact that i'm still alive maybe. yeah i don't know cycling the comic-con i was pretty proud of that pretty proud that i managed to do it. just. i don't you know i don't really know i don't really use the term pride and i really feel pride. i'm just it's more like the fact that i'm still alive i'm proud to be alive. i don't know if that makes me humble or just insane. who knows. do i press the button now i'll buy. okay. to who do do do do do. by the way her eyes are really creepy. just saying that. it's just the way that they say that they have the uncanny.,1,0,2,0.7857004,0.21429959,,,,,483
43,217,yes. alright. i was born in los angeles california. i want the weather and. the fact that the people aren't so obtrusive like on the east coast. just the the traffic in the smoky weather. i used to i'm unemployed now so i'm rarely go anywhere. i have a bs in business with a computer option. i thought that the only place i can get a job with a business degree was in accounting or in business computer message so i took that i took business computer math adoption. i probably be. professional sports player and actor something something that you enjoy doing. i like to ride my bike i like to watch sporting events now i can't afford to go to them so i pretty much watch on tv. i like to travel but like i said i don't have money for that anymore. that's all right. people who are chicken heads they getting their nose in other people's business even if they're just strangers expect that from a family member. where are friend but you know fishing with the internet that feeds a lot of that now we know what orwell is referring to when he spoke the big brother in 1984. i don't do much him much different than i would otherwise. and i had many temper outbursts. girl you was my aunt. and it was because she was basically. making leading statements trying to trap me into saying something about a relative and if you don't know i'd me greatly. i'm kind of on the outs with my parents. the black sheep. i mean my mom's done the most to help me she's done a lot you know more than anybody by far. well i mean she's just me one time when i was in like 15 i went with a friend of mine to see the crosby stills nash and young concert at the forum and she has seven kids and she pick me up at the sizzler is right across the street from the forum at 11 at night and i couldn't imagine the others had to do that day that she agreed to do that but she did. oh probably. going down to the cape at the end of a baja peninsula and cabo san lucas or photograph in the bridal veil falls in yosemite. i was by the two most majestic see sites i've ever seen. it was when i could afford to travel. no. no. i was diagnosed with depression after a hospital visit in april of 2011 and i took some lexapro but i stopped after one day i didn't want to do it anymore. no. because i didn't feel it was help i feel i was becoming a zombie. yeah. depressed about not having a job for over two years i lost my job in october 2010 and except for you nose job like this which i'm fortunate to get just neon daily things focus groups like that i haven't worked. thank you. ashley when you're 56 years old. well just get the general feeling of hopelessness. i get out of my bicycle out of walkthrough bikes 4 hours a day spent about 2 hours each. yeah it's good to me. very easy. cuz now i'm old when i was young i couldn't sleep more than 4 6 hours a night. cuz i'm restless. are you triggered by something no. but now that i'm old i am i sleep much more easily. i pray before i go to sleep and that that's it that's when i can't have any trouble sleeping i just pray beside different prayers like the lord's prayer hail mary stuff like that and i'm leaving to fall off to sleep. i don't know probably. you have any news civic remembrances. i love that you know it was when i had money to spend i know that and when i had to have a job to have money to spend so it's probably 15 years ago. well. i haven't really enjoyed anything that last week i did a made $75 on that job with the the county basically it was an emergency preparedness exercise they were running for their personnel and the enlisted people to play. the basically the relatives of people who'd been in this fall bombing at the staple center and we you know ask question sign up unit on giving information on missing you no relatives and basically i was provided by the county and they said they went to a routine in downtown la. that's not hard it was just a just a routine we had to follow we had to act like we were actually missing somebody and had to give this ethics of their characteristics height weight excetera. i don't have a best friend. i'm a very bright i'm a perfectionist at my job. i bet about it. i got a business degree and i'm never been a motivated person i went to school i went to. 2 state colleges in two junior colleges to need that in so i believe that was probably the most significant contribution that i made to my. anatomiya i guess self-esteem you might say i had something to hang on the wall. yeah i regret you know alienating family members. i would have. basically not been so impetuous and left left jobs think thinking that you know i can always get another one and not you know basically blow-off jobs i could probably work at one of the employers that i used to work for now. fade out and locations but i burn bridges there so that's not possible. thank you. hasta luego.,1,0,2,0.5847392,0.41526082,,,,,355

the people everyone's nice i love the diversity you know there's different types of people in the imaginations out there you know everything's just great you know everyone's different you know one's like the same at least to some aspects and i love the scenery i love you knows the mountains they're beautiful you know great for hikes you know taking out you know the dog the family you know it's nice it's pretty active. the smog i don't like the smog it's just you know if you go out and further out you know you could tell by the air you know or you know everything's clear the sky is bluer but other than that like you know what traffic nobody likes traffic i think. yeah but yeah that's pretty much he's pretty nice you know i like it. well i was letting just basic you know i'm not sure exactly what i want to be so it's just kind of you know here and they're just jumping through hoops and stuff so not really that yet it's still trying to find my interest i suppose. so. my dream job since that's a good one i love working with children so i would say probably a child psychologist just cuz you know it's great you know to learn what's going on the young minds and you know how we could help children develop a better way you know make children you know or help you know help them you know grow up in a positive way i suppose instead of like going the wrong track yeah. i just you know help children. depends it depends on the situation a man sometimes you know i could be like super outgoing and just like you know and sometimes i could just i could be all quiet or what not and just paying attention you know if i'm like a class or whatever i don't really like in these everyone talking i just i prefer just to stay away from that you know cuz i need something else to concentrate on something else you know there's like a moment in time for everything i supposed. yeah. i like to kick my feet up in the couch and like really good book you know just get my mind going to another you know galaxy or universe or situation you know it's pretty funny. just you know reading and i'm just having yourself relax then you know feeling good. yeah it is it is fun i love reading. i'm okay with it i'm not like the best you know the temper controlling person there is out there you know i tried my best and i guess that's all i could do until i keep doing better eventually but i'm not like the best i mean i sometimes i do have my outburst you know but you know i guess that's everyone i'm not sure if. haha that's a good question. i don't remember lipsi. honestly i can't recall maybe. my goodness. i i don't know i'm very passive that. just like let things go cuz i mean what's the point of making a big deal out of things you know so i don't know i'm not i i can't i honestly i can't tell you that. why don't we talk about that later i'm sure yeah probably come back to me. haha well i guess when i was younger i dunno could have been better older sister and i i wasn't and that makes me feel guilty for sure you know i could have been a better sister. better role model you know but i'm trying my best now so i'm trying to make things better. yeah. i guess huh. i don't know i mean i'm the person i am because of the events that have happened in my life so if i erase something then it's just there's something of me and my present self or you know they would change and i don't know i'm pretty okay with the person that i am now i mean you know i don't think i would change an event you know i'm i'm okay with what you know about sand down and get them bad that has happened. yeah. i can't see your shoes but i don't travel a lot but i am kind of like an explorer i guess i love to explore like even the smallest things like if i go hiking i go out trail and you know just find my way up to the top you know somehow some way and just make it you know traveling i would love to do that but i don't know it just you know always circumstances in my life that doesn't you know always something you know i'm getting married children you know and all this so it's kind of like you know. it would be nice i guess you know it would be nice you know i love camping that's kind of like you know taking a few days trips out there camping you fishing yeah. since it was this summer you know me and my husband went camping and it was really nice was just me and him you know and it was like no one and it was like beautiful cuz it was just in the middle of the woods with a beautiful lake and you know it was it was really nice it just yeah. hell. yeah yeah it was it was it was really fun it was like i would love to do it again you know right now it would be great and you know it just going out there it's just i love that venture of things and the nature and just life and you know overall. it's it's easy but lately i haven't been able to sleep like at night right away because i don't know just you know just i'm laying there and i'm just like trying to go to sleep and i'm just a car but eventually i do you know i just i probably like me to position myself in a different side of the bed like sometimes i'm i'm in the headboard and i'm like i got to go to the other side once i position myself and i just like go to sleep you know but it just i got to find the the right position for me. yeah. i'm tired i get tired throughout the day you know but i kind of try to shake it off you know and just kind of like feel like it's a new day you know and just try to make the day that i have as great as possible you know and then try to like make it up by sleeping at night that they are so yeah yeah yeah it's just it's okay i try to make it the best i guess if not then i just go to sleep throughout the day which sucks but yeah. i know. no. everything good yeah i've been feeling really good you know a lot of things in my life have you know it. i'm having a really good year so far so i'm very happy with that you know everything's you know going good you know. yeah it is it is except that i just got out of a cold and it was horrible but that's just nature. super happy was when the doctor told me i was pregnant you know i was really really happy about that and i was just like all you know that was really really good you know. very excited and just reading about what's going on with my body and what's going on with the baby and. who's it's very overwhelming and it's scary at the same time i've never really liked it very happy. no. i guess just me myself you know like you know i could you know just be myself and that's it you know just i can't really you know say i have specific thing i guess i didn't mean it depends on the person that meets me to tell me i can't really tell myself like i'm this and that you know just try to be my best and try to portray something good for other people. you know tell me or if you don't compliment me or whatnot yeah. nothing i think like i said i'm happy with the person i am right now and you know my flaws or whatever you know i might have i don't know whatever flower people see in me and it's okay you know i'm okay with it whatever it's just i'm not going to change myself for the likings of other people i have only one body and one life so yeah. yeah that's it. just my childhood with my sisters and my family but you know it's you know how you learned from that you know from the past and you kind of feel like hey you know maybe i should be a better role model you know for my children and so my children could be better role model so the world could just improve. just smile and be happy you know and whatever hard things happened you know you're going to get through it and eventually you know the only thing you can tell i don't know you can you no go back on his desk you know you could you know how hard break or whatever but you know song is i'm alive i still got to keep going. that's pretty most proud of i guess that i'm trying my best to be the best i could be and that's pretty powerful you know you know i try to be you know. a better person each day and try to like you know i'm prove myself every day as much as i can you know that would probably be something i could be super proud of you know as much as i can very hard it is really hard you know cuz i can't say you know it's easy to be bad but it's hard to be good you know and you know it's always challenges and everything that goes you know in your life but you know it's just it's it's sometimes you know how hard you know and sometimes it comes easy you know that after a while you get a lot of practice and everything's just like you have a great day and you didn't even try you know. so yeah. you know loving friendly outgoing you know adventures i guess i don't know that's what they say you know that's them like you know but that's what least what i try to be you know at least i try to give the best foot forward always as much as possible and i even sometimes even if i'm having a rough day i'm just like you know you know i just don't want to take it out on anyone or anything you know. yeah. my ideal weekend you should he i i like going to the park i like sitting down in like a tree under a tree at the other three where there's shade and just kind of put my blanket out there have my dog and like read a book and you sometimes if i don't have my dog like there's little squirrels running around and they like me to feed them so that's pretty neat you know just sitting there and just enjoying the air and the noise i guess cuz there's not silence you know the wind and the cars and you know it just it's really neat. yeah. thank you you're welcome.,0,0,3,0.9321809,0.067819156,,,,,369
1,7,okay thank you. thanks for coming in today. created to talk to people and it stays. are you okay with. yes. okay. virginia. i wanted to live somewhere different than virginia with a little bit more of diversity. once a year maybe. add song it's a lot slower and there's a lot left to do there. i wanted to live somewhere different and a nicer warmer climate and somewhere where there's a lot more to do and i was a lot more going on. for me it was really easy cuz i wanted some it was very different and i wanted something different. i like i like all the things to do like the museum's i like the beaches in the mountains and all the hiking and all the free things to do. people don't appreciate what they have here that just come here and want to take something but they don't want to give anything back in bad drivers. i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i have not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot. not as much as i'd like to i travel whenever i can but usually can't afford to you that much. well i like taking i like taking pictures a lot and i just like exploring new places my wife and i like to see you. wildlife and hiking monuments and to seeing different areas. well we. we've got we went to central california we'd like to be able to go more internationally places but that takes a while to afford so we've gone more locally so we went to we went to hearst castle in the c the c the elephant seals and things like that. i guess. i guess our palm springs trip for our anniversary we did the who did the tram in the nice hotel on the jacuzzi and romantic dinner and it was a good time overall. guess somewhere in between. english and film. well i am. was told i needed to go to college in i haven't quite decided what to do yet so i just pick something i like to do for the time being. well wish i had not been pressured so i had more time to figure out what i wanted to i might have done something different like physical therapy but. are you still working or not. i know i've been teaching gymnastics which is something i used to do before. what made you decide to do that. i needed to not starve and it did it it didn't end up being as bad as i thought it would be so i went for it and ended up being kind of fun. dream job is to have money and not have to work for it. okay. how are you at controlling your temper. overall pretty gif. i don't remember what about but it probably would have been few weeks ago with my wife. all anyone that i've ever actually gotten upset and yelled always wish i wouldn't do that but sometimes when someone is not listening it drives me crazy. now if i just saying something over and over and they're just clearly not listening it makes me really upset. tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to me. i don't know i i spent a lot of time on them but i don't i don't know what the hardest one is cuz it if i decide to go with something and you know it's usually for a good reason. what's something you feel guilty about. well i guess i feel guilty about moving to california in that i left my family and virginia i mean i know i shouldn't but they always seem to miss me and even though they don't like living there you know i'm the one that moved away so it's like i abandoned them. well i mean i don't miss virginia but i do miss them so i guess a little hard. i have a good relationship with my. with my wife with my in-laws with my mom dad and sister there's no problems everyone gets along well. very close. mean anything anything where someone gets hurt either physically or otherwise. depends on how much exercise i have get a lot of exercise is pretty easy if i don't it's not. kind of like right now just a little bit. swelling out of it but not really too different otherwise. how do you been feeling lately. i'm just kind of run-down cuz my um my mother-in-law's is dying and we just spent like 3 days in the hospital and we're going to go back after this so not a lot of time to sleep. just some. just us just slower and more tired and a little more out of it that's all. have you ever been tigers. no. now. usually just when i'm having having a fun day either on my own or with my wife that's it's pretty easy for me just getting outside and and and hiking or exercising not hard for me. i'm not sure maybe i'm maybe like eccentric but in a good way hopefully. is there anything you regret. no. 2. be careful with your to be careful with your job to make sure you could keep from being injured and two. i don't know just just your normal your normal kind of older kind of wisdom. can you tell me about that. not much just a really everyone realizes things when they get older they wish they had when they were younger. what are some things you wish you can change about yourself. i wish i could get rid of my back injury so i could get back into shape like i used to be at some the biggest thing right now. not much to say just hurt my back at work and i just like to get past it cuz it's you know holding me back from doing a lot of things that's all. smile like you used to do gymnastics and trampoline and used to be a lot more active or work out more and now i can only work out a little bit cuz it hurts too much. tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. probably like during that during the day going going on a hike or to a park with my wife and enjoying taking pictures and wildlife and exercising and then at night you know if we watch a movie or go dancing or just something like that. is proud of them proud of moving here and then i came here without knowing anyone and i was at a point where i could have stayed in virginia and gotten comfortable and you know ended up doing something i regretted but i came out and i've always thought that was a good decision. my parents my grandparents my wife most people in my life have been. i think i got everything i need.,0,0,3,0.8745529,0.12544718,,,,,396

3,11,forget you can ask you some questions to let you know when she's done and. okay. are you okay with this yes. pretty good. alexandria virginia. i'm to la end of 2001. yeah it's crazy. a couple times a year usually like for holidays. it is it's very different. i think it's a lot more mellow it's way more like suburbia it's nice if there's something comforting about it but it's always like i got a little restless when i'm there and look forward to coming back here where there's a little more action. i went to grad school at usc. it was it wasn't bad i mean my my program that i was in was so intense that like for the first year it was so all consuming that i really didn't have much spare time to think about the adjustment it was just like my life is not my own so that made it kind of easier i guess and also i was like in a community of people that i went to school at so automatically i knew people and you know made friends and stuff so it wasn't bad. i had an epiphany one day i was out of undergrad i was kind of floundering a little bit i didn't really know what i wanted to do and just one day i kind of was like you know what am i really excited about one of my really passionate about and i realize that movies are the thing that i love the most and i most passionate about that is how i decided to go to film school. are you still doing that. a little bit yes and no it's that sound like in a little bit of a transitional. right now but yeah like for the last several years i've been producing like freelance producer. that is so the question of the moment. i think that. i don't necessarily have like a a job title that's my dream job but i know it's sort of what i want it cuz basically like i've been living a freelance lifestyle for a while and i know that that is like exhausting and i don't want to do that anymore so i'm looking for something that's stable you know full-time nice benefits and i want to stay in the entertainment industry and i like you know what i love about pretty thing is that it's just like there's constant challenges and assertive never know what is going to get thrown out you that i bet you know it's always interesting and exciting so i'm sort of trying to figure out right now what would be a good. place for me to be where i can be reasonably challenged and you know have sort of like room to to grow and advance and all that. yeah. i can't see your shoes i i like to travel i don't know that i haven't really been doing it a lot lately but i have you know in the past. and fairmount. i want the adventure of it just you know new experiences new places new people i think it's just good to sort of get out of your little insular world and see what's out there and just you know see beautiful remarkable places and and things and just experienced different ways of living in different languages in different cultures. let's see i went to costa rica a couple years ago my best friend from growing up she and i went for like 10 days and it was that's probably that might be like my favorite trip of all time and beautiful and we just spent like we went to three different places and just did a lot of exploring and like sightseeing we did a ton of hiking which was amazing and then like the last picture we ended up with this little beach town so i'll buy that point it was like we felt like you know we had done all this like an amazing physical exertion like doing zip lines and all these hikes to the by the time i got to the beach it was like we've earned the right to just like kick back and relax and you know so it was just it kind of it hit all of the you know it like fed that sort of desire for adventure and activity. but i also i'm also a big fan of vacations where you just like veg out and relax and like my own of each with a book so it sort of hit everything. hey. but it's the best i've got.. what should i do to relax. i mean depending where i am like if it's you know something at work or something and i'm stressed out i just will you know kind of take a minute and just like breathing really deeply and try to calm myself down that way if i'm home i might just like you know they're on a movie or like a tv show that i really liked and just that gives a sense of play sort of escape release. pretty good i don't i mean it takes a lot to get me very angry it doesn't happen very often. the last time i argue with someone with my mom and it was about money. i felt really frustrated because i felt like she was like judging me unfairly. and i was upsetting. it's good you know they live across the country for me so i don't get to see them that often but like i usually talk to. my mom on the phone probably like once a week and my parents are really supportive they are you know like when i go back home to visit like i i enjoy hanging out with them with a good time by timmy have a pretty pretty good relationship. play i feel guilty about. i guess because i'm like in this term job-hunting phase i feel guilty sometimes that i'm not like doing enough you know if like there are times where it's at their day is or maybe like i should have sent out a few more resumes are done more stuff like i i feel guilty sometimes for not being like productive enough. how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep. usually it's pretty easy that lasts the last couple weeks like has been uncharacteristically like not as good. i'm not really sure i haven't figured it out but i just had more like nights where it either takes me a really long time to go to sleep or i wake up in the middle of the night for no reason i've also been having a lot of like really weird intense dreams that like i wake up sometimes i wake myself a king but it's weird so yeah it's just i don't know. i need triggered by something. not that i have been able to identify i mean i guess maybe i'm like more stressed than usual just cuz like my job situation is like influx but i don't know if there's no lick event. cranky. i value a good sleep and i'm so used to it so it's just that it's not a good feeling. not really no. yes. like. i think i'm like october or november although this is the second time it's happened in my life but the first time was like. many many years ago. i felt like i was a really low and like too low for me to get myself out of it. just having a hard time. functioning on the most basic level like just getting up and taking a shower and like going to the grocery store and you know answering emails was just like. it took so much energy so yeah i just i wasn't really. functioning normally. yeah. yes. yes sometimes more than others but yeah overall i would say so. i think that sarah p is good for me because it. help me focus on. my sort of patterns and also like. just like observing how i am like responding to certain situations and just i guess it's because we have more hate and like kind of self-awareness so that as opposed to just like. kind of just reacting to situations i'm like just like noticing more what is going on and it just helps to. i don't know it's just helpful. i don't know. play not good that i can think of i can't think of anything. that may be over. over christmas being at home with my family. well it just was. that was like i was kind of like just starting to come out of my depression then and. like yeah i live alone here i have a dog but so i just had a long. of. feeling not great and just sort of doing it all on my own and kind of wishing that my family was around me so when i was there with them it just. it just felt very like. safe and comfortable and not just sort of like you no more miss amelia land brace. i think she would describe me as. funny and smart and. a good listener non-judgemental. i don't know. got enough. okay. so this happens. the last like job that i had i mean i was it wasn't technically i was a freelancer but i was working for this company for like. a year-and-a-half to two years and. had a very small company that had a really good relationship with my boss and he threw up out of nowhere. told me that he was like downsizing basically and. essentially like the arrangement that we had is that he paid me like a monthly retainer for my services and then on top of that i would get paid fees per project so he looks at me down in this conversation was like you are major client that is like you know the bread and butter of the company that if they're really coming back like you probably noticed things are going really slow and i was like yeah he's like so i'm going to have to stop paying you your retainer and this is a total surprise and i was like okay and he went on to talk about how he i would still have the right of first refusal of all the projects that came to the door and you know because of that he made it seem like you know even though i wouldn't be getting a retainer anymore he would throw enough work at me still that like i wouldn't you know it wouldn't be like a dramatic decrease in the money that i was making. but and he was like you know this has nothing to do with the quality of your work i love working with you you're fantastic yada yada so to make a long story short what ended up happening is he was firing me and he that was his way of basically like phasing me out of the company and letting me go because from that point he stopped calling me such a emailing me and later on like a couple of months down the road i had to go back into the office because there were a couple projects that were still ongoing with the client took a really long time to get back with their notes and when i was in there i stop that. this guy who had worked with us a bunch kind of like if we needed another producer like if we were to plant we would bring him on to do sort of additional stuff he was doing my job so yeah so it just like. it was a really shity way to be like fired without being told that i was fired and it was just like. that is the reason i would like to if i could i would erase that from my mind is because i can't really think of another situation that made me feel so like angry and frustrated and just like in a way it's like it's still even though this was like you know several months ago feels very unresolved and still makes me kind of like angry when i think about it so yeah that was very long explanation. a very loyal person i am smart i am organized i. very like carrying kind. i'm conscientious and i work hard. man. i think. 2. be more confidence. and. less passive to really. like focus on. what i wanted a things that i know will make me happy and to just go out and get them as opposed to sitting back and waiting for opportunities to prevent themselves. probably just some of the. relationships that i formed with people. just like really you know deep friendships. you're welcome. bye. just just like right before you walked in. i take this off.,0,0,3,0.75177675,0.24822323,,,,,374

because i tend to be very stoic i don't tend to. i don't know express myself so much and i tend to be very reserved and not. really forthcoming about my feelings etc. i'm not sure i understand the question exactly but. i can't really say i just i just retreat within myself and i don't. tend to express what i'm thinking or feeling. that makes sense. i'm second. second place. what the. whipping. what do i do when i'm alone bicycle locks. yeah right by school like very like everywhere i'm a bicycle commuter and i also like and i'll read a lot. i'm very good at controlling my temper i don't. i mean i'm so good at repressing repressing my feelings are that my very really express i mean i don't know i don't really express anger or else i don't really feel anger because. i'm not an angry person i may be very disappointed at when something bad happens but that won't erupt in a in a rage i don't feel i don't really feel rachel but i know i'm so exposed to it all the time on the road i see people like me at all yelling at each other and screaming has so it's yeah i totally cultivate my serenity. what time i argue with someone. which would have been the job-related arguments and. now what i said in school. i started english. american literature. currently unemployed then was my most recent job was at as a as a tutor and before that i've been a grant writer payroll clerk. i've had like an assortment of jobs. yeah i agree i agree. what's my dream job. i'd like to be an editor i'd like to. like i'd publications. or like right stories for publications i feel more comfortable being another direction more comfortable like working with pros done with i guess i producing my own. so i like to be like another applications editor. yeah. travel a lot. i'd like to travel i've tried before. one of those memorable experiences i. i'm pretty close to my family back out here to be closer to them about 2 years ago from chicago and so i'm closer to them now, but i don't know it was kind of a mistake professionally cuz i haven't been able to get anything going out here and so i probably should have stayed in chicago. i'm sick and i'm sorry i don't really understand. i'm pretty well chicago it was fun over there was working as a grant writer and we're there for grad school but either dropping out of grad school but the finding work has been over 5 years i like it alot. mallory situation i'm okay with it right now i'm living with a relative it's. it could be better but right now is like right now but employed and it's like i said anything to me stay rent-free and so i'm okay right now before i'm at but i really do need to find another job so i can. i get myself stabilized. yeah i'm living with my uncle and. you know like i say at this place and so. he's kind of eccentric. i don't know how subscribe them he's pretty out there but anyway he's okay guy. do i have a source of what. i'm sorry do i have. i can really barely hear what you're saying and it's hard for me to understand you sometimes but i'll wait for you to answer me or ask me a question. no i haven't. no i haven't but i've. awesome felt oppressed. but i never had a diagnosis of depression. i've been feeling good lately i mean relatively i mean. i prefer being unemployed and feeling like really angsty over that that's. you know i'm in a position where i can you know you know i can't sort of like survive out here which is important and. and i'm not homeless which is important so i feel okay i mean yeah i could be doing a lot better on the other hand i'm not on the streets and things could be much worse. no i haven't. i'm not sure what the question was if i'd like to send some kind of therapy. i've been in therapy before but it hasn't. i don't know i was supposed to be there people like the therapist and i wasn't like really. it didn't really help me out so much like a slight work at my issues but i enjoy talking to a therapist and i guess that's kind of like a pair of the whole situation to to the scenario talking to a virtual human that you just have someone to sit with for a while he will listen to you it someday i could be very soothing melody. i feel that way often well do i feel like i need to talk to someone very often. sometimes i mean yeah i do like repressed emotions like man the pretty much i assumed i could ever become black holes with someone i would have someone i can share my thoughts and feelings with butts. i was like i guess you can say i do feel what's the word i feel lonely but not lonely but like for a self contained within. what's the word within my own sort of sense of self my own feelings and i don't really. have a need to reach out as much because. i'm a practice god i practice meditation and i totally totally helps me like next to retreat into myself in lights are like fine fine serenity serenity through a lack of desire and soap that helps me with. i mean i guess i could loneliness but also i mean maybe it was like you know it like a problem i actually don't reach out to people as often as i should but i definitely neglected relationships because of that. and it may all be as like self-centeredness you know but. i'm trying to oh yeah this is a good one i want to try to find a way to lake engage with people without like really. allowing myself to let them down so to speak and so that is. one of the things that inhibits me from reaching out to people is the idea that i could that i could potentially let them down if they were to place their faith in me or the trust in me and so i'm very reluctant to do that. go on. how easy it is for me i don't really again i'm only hearing part part of what you're saying and so. this is going to throw off my answer. i would say it's very easy i mean i can't really like i don't understand the question for quan. what i'm i think i said it would only was afraid of probably most afraid of. oh my god being a failure or not being a success finding a stable job. not being able to. i mean settle down and essentially ain't getting married. it's um i don't know i am okay with being single i'm not okay with being jobless. i'm so it's like one of those things that's just like. i just i don't feel i can reach out to people so because i don't have a job and so i got to like bring them into my mic my life so right right now i'm not in position to like a people i mean. they have a lot of friends with us because i can't like really go outside and they can so you know spend money at. and restaurants or in clubs or whatever. so i'm going to buy to a lots and i think a lot so i meditate a lots and i read a lot of literature. i want to go to my felt really happy. well just last weekend that was set my. my aunt and uncle's 50th one of your anniversary and it was a nice occasion it was really it was not their whole family was there are friendly was there and. like my own parents 50th anniversary is coming up 50/50 years together and. i felt really happy for them i felt really happy that i got both of them and provided us with like a really. a really great childhood and. it seems strange i guess i put that kind of starting point but that's something i mean i guess like suit to be floundering right now but i feel happy for the. i think i guess locations like that are probably could become rarer on his light on a societal level but that some sort of like beyond leon sort of like realm of happiness and anyway this weekend. i'm on the road on a bicycle and going pretty fast. how are your best friends. my best friend. actually. she would describe me as depressed all the time and i asked her about this and he's like i swear if it being around me i had brought her down at all because she was going through her own like for a deep depression that i was kind of trying to coax her out of that but it sometimes myself and so. i asked her if you're around me brought her down at all and she said no it's it made her that i had liked it but i take an interest in her but. what's the word let's would like my sort of like my depression wasn't like really the net didn't have anything to do with her depression it was completely unrelated to like how i felt and feel like i don't know in both cases it was just good to have someone else to be around who had some respect for. like it's like how we felt or like alarm useful sort of like lack of feeling and i can put it that way and so has being brave i seem very depressed all the time and she's my best friend. at this moment. anything i regret. all right. thank you. goodbye. hello and goodbye. hello. it was kind of interesting as like i should have like told you i had like my ears are kind of kind of clogged and so i had trouble like during her at some at some

6,23,okay great thank you. yes. doing pretty good. all i was born in brooklyn new york i came out here when i was seven and i've been here ever since i don't consider myself anything but oak california. i'm a welder. i just i don't know it was something about making and building things and repairing things that intrigue me and i was actually pretty good at it so i stuck with it and and that's my profession. t i really never had that i've just kind of always hope that i would have a job that could support myself and my family and i was satisfied with that. well i just recently lost my uncle and he raised me since i was 7 years old and other than my wife i don't have any more family he passed away last july and. starting to get over it i knew the day would come but he was my last living relative so. i've been depressed about that and i'll but i'm doing better. it depends on the atmosphere if i'm around people that i don't feel comfortable with kind of reserved but if i'm comfortable and i feel like i fit in i'm not going. screensaver. right. i enjoy old movies old while it's called film noir and i love those old black-and-white movies and i get on netflix or amazon and i try to pick a movie that from back then people were different than day i don't know it's just a different era and i enjoy it. my wife says i probably is not as good as i think i do but i've got to admit sometimes i lose my temper and it is according to her over things that i shouldn't be losing my temper about but i'm working on it and i have basically had this problem ever since i was young child. oh yes. i've been in and out of trouble with the law when i was much younger i'm past that point now but you know when you're young you think you know everything and you know you never going to get old and the future doesn't matter but it does matter because everything that you do when you're young follows you for the rest of your life and. i don't regret things that i've done but if i could go back i definitely would make different choices. me and my wife we we don't argue we disagree and it's she's very strong-willed and she's a match for me so we go back and forth but we don't get violent and we don't say meaningful things or hurt each other we're just she is a determined strong-willed woman and i am who i am so we kind of go back and forth and. lately i have been the one to bow down and be the one to lower the threshold of the argument because in the long run it's just her and me and there's nobody else more important to me. when i was younger i wish that i didn't follow some of the people that i followed and what i mean by that is no running in a circle with a certain people i am having an ego bigger than my common sense and that's what got me into trouble i was an only child and. i kind of enjoyed being the center of attention and. getting the girls to laugh or having people think i was going to cool or whatever you wouldn't think that now i'm kind of overweight involving but when i was in my twenties i was at a completely different person and. if i would have had some brothers and sisters i may not have thought or acted that way but i was an only child so. i. you know where and we're. people thought i was cool and that got me into trouble. tell me about the hardest decision i've ever had to. hardest decision i ever had to make was. giving the authorization to. have my uncle passed away he was on life support and his kidneys have failed and. doctor said there's nothing more i could do and to not have him go through any suffering. to let him slip away. michigan see i get very upset my uncle. raised me like his own son and. never let me down. and he's gone and. for lack of a better word to push the button i never thought i would have to do that. but as i said i'm getting over it and. things are getting better slowly. my wife she is always there for me she will always surprise me we she's not my wife she's my best friend and she knows me better than i know myself we enjoy doing simple things it's not that we can't do other things if we wanted to but we mesh we enjoy each other's company we like the same things and we you know occasionally go out and do something together but we we just enjoy each other's company and she like i say knows me better than anybody in the enzyme it surprised me sometimes. how is your day. you know lately when i can't say lately if i don't excuse me if i don't do. a rigorous activity or something that really stresses me or strained my body at let's say for a couple of days i'm just very relaxed and not doing much. i just automatically get up after 4 and 1/2 5 hours i mean en mi y physician now that you're not getting any sleep but i mean i don't feel tired i don't feel so exhausted i don't feel like i need to go back to sleep i'll stay up all day and i'm fine and most people will say that's not enough sleep but you know for me it doesn't affect me. well it was some things could be different but i'm not dissatisfied i'm happy with my life that they're like with anybody else there's a few things that i wish would different and i think that's an anybody everybody else has no life but i'm content. yeah i feel a little less motivated. recently well i can't say recently this was back in january. my wife and a few friends were noticing that i was becoming forgetful and i couldn't remember things i didn't see it and you know when they wouldn't everybody brought it to my attention then i started to anyway i went to the doctor and they gave me the test and apparently i have mci which is mild cognitive impairment and i've over the last month or so. nobody has mentioned it to me i'm a man maybe i'm getting better but the neurologist that i saw us as having me come back in a year and going to retest me hopefully it's not the beginning stages of alzheimer's i'm still a little young for that i'm away from 52 but i was diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment and it could have been due also i was told by him because of the death of my uncle i could have been very depressed and i was not able to retain things and. tell work i'm going back in a year and we'll see if i'm any better. i'm sorry. i'm not understanding you i'm sorry. no no i have not. yes. 2001. i was in a what is the word i'm looking for i was in a. in a state of mind of where i was just going to get myself in trouble and and not benefit anything if i didn't seek any help i was diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder waring and thinking too much about things and thinking the worst and. i i take medication for that. well you know it's not really therapy it's you know every few months you know you got to see the doctor are you doing fine everything good and you know they just refill your prescription it's in alphabet you know kind of like the next person next person that is i am with kaiser so it sits they'll talk to you but it did they give you the impression that. you know i okay let's move along you know that they'll hear your explanation but you know they don't have all the time for you that you may want so i'm doing fine now if i really needed help i would i would do something the medication works for me. last time i felt real happy. well it would depend on what the event is i'm always happy when i'm doing something with me and my wife and we're enjoying each other and i ain't no i'm not trying to sound like she's my whole world and i don't have anything else she is my world but i enjoy being with her and we we we do things together and i'm happy all the time when when we're doing that when i'm outside of that circle. i don't know if the sounds right but i'm not seeking happiness i i can only explain it as i'm content i'm not. i'm not disappointed or i'm not wanting anything i'm being whatever comes my way is fine so. well. i don't know why i couldn't give you that answer i want my best friend is my wife but she would describe me is i don't think before i speak i let the littlest insignificant things bother me and i get angry over but the big things it's like i let it go and she's bewildered by that. years and years ago she had a classic pontiac lemans and she had got into a minor fender-bender and she thought it was going to be the end of the world cuz that was my baby and i don't worry we'll get it fixed and she what she thought was going to hang or something this was as you know it was my baby and she calls you know you you get excited over nothing but you know i ate something like wrecking your car that you love and he put so many hours of work into it money. it all gets crashed and it's like you don't care so. that's the only way i can explain it. well i need to lose some weight if you could say i'm definitely been on the eating beans and the neurologist said that's probably due to the event with my uncle i'm here i am this is the heaviest ever been in my life and i'm finding it a little bit harder i can't say harder but i'm finding the willpower. just say no and stick with it and to go exercise or not you no movement now gourmet before walking on me and my wife and we were a little bit younger we used to love going for walks and we lived in a. hey boy you don't look at that wonder what's inside their er at that's the way that we don't do that no more i guess it's worth a little bit older now and. trouble heavy retarded to walk with all this weight but i i i wish i could change that because. this is not a healthy size. lately. no i don't regret anything lately everything's been fine the i could say that the biggest. biggest impact in my life was the event with my uncle and i never ever. in a hundred years there ever thought that i would face that situation and i'll never forget it but. they say time heals all wounds and and it does. don't listen to other people. again i'm not trying to bring up my uncle just because of what has happened but he used to constantly tell me to he would see the things that i was doing in the pads that i was going down and i constantly thought i knew better and i think a lot of youngsters think that anyway they the young lady that i was talking to in here they think they're invincible and so did i i figured i'd never going to god i'm never going to have those problems i wish i could have changed some things the history of my past follows me as it does everybody and that has limited me and in a lot of opportunities and a lot of things that i'm able to do i don't miss them but if i could go back 10 or 20 years i definitely wouldn't make some of the decisions i made. my welding certificates i'm certified by the american welding society and i have that's probably the biggest achievement that i made for you know myself an accomplishment. people that i know say that i'm well i haven't been working on cars lately but they said that i have a natural knack for restoration and working on vehicles and i don't see it but i've been told that once or twice but i i've kind of. i've kind of started to slip away from that i don't know why i can't say from lack of interest but i just don't feel the motivation no more i wish i had a pocket of money and i have somebody else to it that's how i feel. okay well thank you. bye-bye. hey. okay well i'll tell you know after a couple of minutes.,1,1,3,0.24506442,0.7549355,,,,,448

8,31,wow okay. when you're finished when she's done. okay. thank you. how are you doing today okay how about yourself. here in california. all well that is big and bras a lot to do a lot of. i'm job opportunities than other states pretty much that is big and it's a lot you can do here. traffic maybe. the violence right the bad news even though you don't even want to know what's going on in your environment but you still have to watch it so you can you know look out to see what's going on on a daily basis. sociology i have a. 2 year degree in liberal arts but my major was sociology. no i'm actually mta bus operator. what's your. well since metro is study growing my dream job is to move up in the company and i'm about to actually start some classes for supervisor free next week so cuz they look to promote within the company so that's a good thing is a lot of opportunities at metro where you can take classes in their pay for your tuition and things of that nature. thanks. well it's not actually hard as right now is easy if you take advantage of it right now cuz they look to promote within so you know since i'm already working there that's a good thing so is good to go ahead and take the classes that you need that you're interested in and go ahead and move up the ladder as soon as possible. what do you mean i'm sorry. okay. free take a long walk hot bath. meditate just close my eyes sometimes. okay. i'm pretty much good because see by me being a bus operator you run into circumstances and situations you got to remain calm and still remain professional at the same time. well i look at it like it it goes with a ami comes with experience you know you do something on a continuous basis usually you somewhere down the line you become good at it you know so i i look at it like that so i've been driving for years and dealing with the public so it's just how you handle circumstances how you treat people like you want to be treated. i'm pretty good at it now maybe when i were younger you know you as you get older you get wiser you learn different things and i'm still learning today. i will say my family you know my kids so you know even though you don't have been having a lot of deaths around me but that's just that's part of the. life experience you know you born here but you got to leave here one day but. my kids will keep me you don't saying and you know i love them in my family. thank you. no. set good examples you know because you're the first teacher you know and you want to set a positive good example for your kids and i think that's a good thing and it starts at home. well. by you being the first teacher your kids you're that you're you're the one that they see on a daily basis when they wake up so whatever's been taught in the home they looking and learn everyday you know brother is that homeschool you know kids have a tendency to do things with a c you know what i mean so you try to keep it positive teaching good morals and values and how to get along with other people regardless of race and you know different things of that nature. i have a 4 1/2 year old son i have a seven-year-old daughter and i also have a 23 year old. yeah i'm about to be well my daughter's pregnant with the boy she has three little girls go have three grand kids and one on the way which is the boy this time. yeah thank you. the hardest thing is we're right now i'm a single parent so that makes it hard alone itself you know and. they can be expensive at times you know and depends on the person's situation you know whether they have helped or job you know things of that nature to help the situation better but it's hard you know but you are trying to keep a job you know keep food in the house you know just maintaining support my kids the best way i can. with my kids or just.. what's memorable for me is that i'm the only one in my family with a degree so it's kind of like yeah it's kind of even though i'm the baby of 10 kids you know and i always kept in the back of my mind even though everybody will pretty much my whole family have decent job but i'm the one with the degree so i kind of like gave myself a pat on the back like you know you know i just that's the only thing i remember and graduating you know and my family is there to support me. thank you. happy that i accomplished something you know just even though it may not be much but it was better than just having a high school diploma and i had i was working on my bachelors degree but i ended up in a bad car accident i never went back i got distracted and you know i was working at the same time but i was just like more so i needed income then then i'm schooling at that time because i was a young parent you know cuz i have my daughter at 17 so i was like i made it the money to support her but i never went back but i feel like it's never too late so i feel like i take some classes now that i'm with metro to help me move up the ladder so that's why i'm starting my class next week. thank you. well device i would have gave myself. then i probably would have been a young mother at a young age and that. i probably wouldn't. stayed in school you know not let the accident just distract me and not i would have remained in school i probably would have had kids early you know. whether i probably would have stayed in school and probably have a part-time job or something just i just feel like education is an excellent thing for a person just having knowledge and learn different things keep your mind open to learning new ideas every day so i think that's a plus you know and anybody shoes that's the better they sells you know through education maybe two maybe promote within your company or whatever the case maybe they help better your career. i'm quite sure you learn from your mistakes you know you but the same time you don't continue to make the same ones i feel like it's okay to make a mistake but long as you do something to change you know like myself even though i'm going to school late but still i'm going you know i want to better myself career-wise so. yes. my oldest daughter. we had an argument because. the life she's living right now in the things that she's going through and i had told her that she just need to make some changes to better her situation and i'll we got into an argument because you know how your kids sometimes don't want to hear it you know here's the stuff that you're saying even though. is true or. or they just you know quote they just don't want to hear it you know they may be going through something they don't want to hear but we got into argument about it but. lettuce happened you know. i just told her my i'm sorry. very close very close is that the situation my daughter's name right now she just needs to make some changes to better her her life. and i've been. she kind of like stubborn in their own way you know i was raised to listen to your mom you know your mom is not going to tell you nothing wrong and i've been telling her over the years you know different things and it's kind of like i was talking to a wall because she did the opposite and now she's she regretting it you know cuz she's like my mom told me that i'm doing the opposite so i guess you got a bump her head a couple of times to get it it's kind of like i didn't told you i left it alone and now it's up to you to make the change. how hot is it. it's very frustrating because it's like i'm talking to a wall and she's not hearing me and i'm like it seems like it's taking forever for the change but it's left up to the individual when they're ready you know what i mean one supposed to get tired of something they make a change it may not be when you wanted to have him but. the ball is in her court you know. only can do so much. oh wow. oh my days. since i have two little ones my kind of like trying to go to bed at 8 because you know they got to go to school and i think it's important have a good night's rest because it kind of like. it it kind of like i guess you're ready for the next day or you know how you going to feel if you rested what type of person going to be that day you know cuz everybody have their days you know rather than good or bad but that's just part of life and i feel like if you had a good night good good night rest hopefully you have a good day you know. pretty much you know i need my rest because i'm out there driving a bus and dealing with all these people and you know the job is stuff is very stressful so i feel like if i'm rested and it helped me. what am i like irritated tired lazy. you know. feel like i want to lay down probably go to sleep. never thought about that you know. cuz like i said you know everybody had a moment to do. i thought about that. no. no. okay. how your best friend describe you i don't really have a best friend but person that i deal with it i used to work with she'll probably tell you that i'm very outgoing a go-getter dependable responsible. i'm a people person. i get along with others you know i'm kind of like. i live in a good mark. whether i know you are not if you was to you know like like you and i now you know i i i. you probably sell she seems like a nice young lady or whatever you know something like that. thank you. well. i try to stay happy i rather be happy than sad my kids keep me going you know what i mean. especially when i go to pick him up from school or just up to me. thank you. you're more than welcome you have a good day. goodbye. you're welcome. okay. that is so

9,36,are there any parameters aren't i mean is should i just talk naturally or just went wherever i'm comfortable okay i get there. one last thing. let you know when she's done i'm going to hand you the. okay. and please. are you okay with this. yes. how are you doing. i'm okay i'm a little. pensive i guess a little down but more or less okay. i was born in annapolis maryland on the east coast. originally i moved because i went to film school and but then i decided to come move back to washington dc to do some work and now i'm back here again. it's very different being from the east coast it just has a different feel to it but living. la is very as a very different kind of attitude i guess and so it's a little difficult but i but i've gotten more used to it since i've been here. not at all when i left things got things are sort of i lost my job out there and so i had to move out here kind of quick to to be with. some people who are going to help me out and i'm just i don't know if it's strange just the right word but i'm kind of not really speaking to my family are old friends that off. it's not easy it's. it's kind of. i miss i miss a lot of people i miss my old life before i lost my job i miss some friends i miss a lot of the relationships that i had out there so it's difficult i mean it weighs on my mind a lot i feel like i failed and now i'm here and i can't seem to get back on my feet so it's it's it's hard. you consider yourself more shy or outgoing. depends on the situation i think i'm out going when i'm comfortable and then i'm extremely outgoing but when i'm in a situation i'm not comfortable with this i tend to be a lot more shy so that doesn't really answer your question but. i have certain. i do i do a lot of writing i have certain music that i listen to as i'm writing and when i can when i can get really into that and sort of shut out the rest of the world the music and the the thoughts just kind of happening really it can it soothed me it's like it's when i feel most relaxed i guess. when is the last time that happened. a few weeks ago i guess i was i've been working on a on a on a book on a novel and when i was really what i was really getting into writing it and. it was really working for me that was that was good that was really good i felt like i was accomplishing something and i was felt really relaxed. what was it about. it was about. guy who's searching for something it's. it's it's his last day on earth and so he's going to find a person that he that he met and just. i was so struck by that he needs to he needs to find her and spend the last few minutes he has on earth with her just because. certified it's sort of romantic adventure comedy kind of thing. what made you decide to do that. well i've always i've always been a writer part of the reason i came to la was because of screenwriting so i wrote some screenplays and you know had a little bit of success with that out here and but since since that i kind of gotten tired of the limitations of the screenwriting and i've started to write more short stories and and longer just creative writing so i've been meaning to write a novel by just waiting for the idea that to really hit me. how hard is that. it's not easy the the parts the parts when it's good it's really good but getting there is sometimes a real struggle i find it difficult i have a real love hate relationship with writing when i when i love it i just absolutely love it but sometimes i hate it because it's so difficult but it's worth it for the times when it when it's good. how are you at controlling your temper. good i don't i don't really have a temper it's not i mean most of my anger that i have is directed inward as opposed to outward to other people if something is really really stressful if i'm in a situation like a very intense confrontation i can lose it but i've put probably only happened to me three four times in my whole life i mean generally i pretty much try to it when i'm upset i get upset with myself not with other people. when was the last time you argue with someone. last night i guess i got in an argument about whether or not. cleaning vegetables was necessary because of i forget but it well know it was about whether you can clean vegetables after you cut them because i'd already started cutting the vegetables and i thought that would be okay so it turned into this big argument and we did google searches to figure out who was right and who was wrong and i i ended up being wrong on that one but it is yeah that was it wasn't a blow-up argument but it was a definite argument. okay. what's something you feel guilty about. lot so much. i was in a relationship that i really really better really wanted to work and. i ended up and it was partly due to i hadn't i was on that i wasn't on the right medication and so i was going like everything that sort of spiraled out of control and i feel really guilty about the way that that ended i mean i wasn't i wasn't mean but i was but i was getting more and more messed up and i couldn't stop it and it ended and so i feel really guilty about not doing enough and and not. and you know making her have to tell me that she never wanted to see me again so. that was pretty that was pretty tough. you've done anything to avoid it. what some of it was was that. i wasn't medicated properly i mean now i've been to a doctor and i'm on medication that's. completely kind of i mean i still get i still get upset and i still get depressed but it's not like it was it's not i don't completely lose it for days at a time so i mean i know there's a part of me that knows logically that it wasn't all my fault and that if i had if i had been able to deal with the chemicals in my brain then i would have then it would have probably been different if i was who i am now then i would have i would i would be. i would be it probably would have gone very differently or maybe it wouldn't have but i mean i could have. i don't know i don't know if i could have done anything different. things being how they were. i mean it's. it's possible i mean obviously. yeah because i mean that's what i do i i. take little i mean i take little things and i just think about them all the time in my head until until it drives me crazy i dwell on stuff and it's like any little detail that comes up i suddenly remember and it can just throw me off for a whole day i mean i still i still get i still get really uncomfortable and embarrassed and i feel ashamed about stuff that i did in high school which was years and years ago i which i shouldn't even be thinking about anymore cuz it's so in the past but i still get that feeling like i'm right back there. that sounds really hard. well it's not easy i've been trying to figure out ways to deal with it i mean i dealt with it for a long time by by by drinking and and you know just trying to slow my mind down that way but you know since the medication it's been better it hasn't been impossible to deal with it hasn't been easy but it's but it's been better. well like i said i do a lot of you know if i'm if i'm writing or if i'm doing anything like i kind of have to almost. you doing two things at once to occupy my brain completely if i'm watching tv i have to be playing a game on my phone if i'm using the computer i have to be you know watching a tv show or a movie on you know on it in another window so that i can just keep my mind occupied during all that. i just need i mean i i wish that i could just sort of let the thoughts come and deal with them but i just i can't yet. i need triggered by something. they're triggered by everything pretty much anything that i said i see if i if i if i hear somebody with a dutch last name if i if i hear somebody talk about wisconsin if i hear you know she will talk about. anyting you know i can reach back and connect to. to this it's really it's really. i don't know that's the thing i mean i don't ever get a break. from it. now. how easy is it for. i'm a very light sleeper so i'm awake and asleep and awake and is i have no problem going back to sleep but i generally you know don't. i don't know i'd never really needed much sleep so it's just only recently that i've really started to like feel the effects of not getting enough sleep like i would i would usually stay up until 2 or 3 in the morning so that i could just be so exhausted that i would just calling out and wake up the next day and feel fine go to work but now it's it's it's like if i do that i can't i still don't get enough sleep i don't clock out i still just sleep very lightly you know i get up i toss and turn all night you know and now. it's just it's. yeah i don't sleep too great right now. pretty i mean i don't know it's hard to it's hard to know i usually just kind of power through it and just i'm at i'm like how i am now i just i just feel bad. okay. how long ago were you diagnosed. i think. 334 years ago. it was when i. i had been given taking stuff for anxiety for 4. years before that but then i finally got a psychiatrist who actually sat down and talked to me and said you actually got this situation and we need to get you the medication that you're on is not working you need to get on this new medication that will actually start to like even you out and heal you a little bit from all this so. so yeah that was that was kind of a turning point but unfortunately it happened after everything went bad so. at the moment i don't know i don't really think i thought about it too much then but looking back on it i feel. it really makes me angry it really makes me you know given where i am right now it makes me really angry that i'm. that i had that i i lost everything because because of chemicals in my brain because of things that i couldn't control and that you know the people that were supposed to help me weren't helping me i mean i was paying i was paying a lot of money to to go see doctors and they were doing it you know it wasn't. it was it didn't help it didn't work until until you know i managed to find somebody who did work and i just yeah so i'm i'm like thanks guys for helping but it was a little it's a little late now. there really wasn't any choice i had to i was i was a mess i was it was either. i was i was self-medicating it was affecting my work i mean it was everything was just there was a point where i really realized that i mean i just had to like make this different but again it was too late because you know then my review came up a few months later and you know after after everything after being institutionalized once or twice and and all this stuff you know they just decided that i was just not worth keeping around so they laid me off. but it was at least that and not. firing me but but but yeah but so i got help but it was. but it wasn't soon enough. not not as much as i should. i go to a couple of meetings i go to i go to aa so that i can you know keep control of that aspect to 2 and there's a there's a therapy aspect that unfortunately you know being unemployed my unemployment ran out you know i'm time you know what i'm getting my medication from the city of la so you know i'm not really in a position to put money into seeing somebody so i have a psychiatrist that i go see but it's really. very i've only seen her three times in the past year so basically to keep my medication coming. then there's you. right. changes have you noticed. well like i said i mean. this the top i mean let's just take the aaa for example because that's probably the close closest for that i'm seeing with therapy right now just saying stuff out loud is just like getting getting the stuff out trying to figure out how to take that mess that's in your stomach and in your brain and make it into words and sentences that make sense. that you can actually deal with is a big step like regardless of who you're saying it to whether it's a a therapist or just a room full of of drugs you know i mean you're you're taking all that stuff that's that's really been killing you and you're making it into something that you can deal with something that you can write down something that you can talk about as opposed to just letting it just sit there as this formless thing. you know better than i that i have been i mean. it is sort of a good it has its ups and downs you know i'm applying for jobs 5-6 jobs or more a day you know i never getting a response never getting an interview never even getting close to 2 to being self-sufficient again it's hard but that's like real world problems i feel like the chemical parts are getting under control like the the depression is getting under control so now it's just i have to deal with real life witches. jazz at the juices don't own challenge. it was probably you know a couple of years ago. i was i mean the thing that immediately comes to mind is everything was going well at my job i was making these great videos with this person that i ate that i was having a relationship with and we were really close we were having fun together and we went out and got a christmas tree. and we spent it all this time picking out the perfect christmas tree and it was just. feeling like a part of somebody's life and feeling like a part of the bigger. the bigger life. that's that's out there you know like what normal people feel. you know for that instant i felt like. a normal person doing a normal thing with a pretty girl who he really really liked a lot and you know everything was going really well and. i mean it wasn't going really well because it was all messed up but for that instant i felt like a normal person a normal happy person and. part of what makes it so hard now is knowing that. i don't know if i'll ever feel that again. so. what are you most proud of in your life. probably the. probably this educate educational series i did educational video series i did for the national science foundation. it was it was really hard and it would but in the end it turned out really good and you know i'm hoping that it helps a lot of kids and it helps the world with getting kids excited about science and about. in about the world around them so that i feel like that was a real contribution that i made to the world. i was part of you know it's part of my my job it was it was a we were trying to come up with with new ideas for because we were put together videos and stuff to give you know to two schools and everything and they had done this before but we decided to do something really big you know when there was a lot of traveling and there was a lot of. and there was a lot to it and so it was probably the biggest. project that the nsf has decided to do and so we just kind of produced it. i guess. i don't know i don't know it's been awhile it's been awhile since i've since i've really thought about that i don't know what i'd go somewhere would i. i don't know. thank you. audi.,1,1,3,0.2904581,0.7095419,,,,,367

it's usually pretty sunny and contemporary you know i like that the climate really a lot of the girls here you know i like let's see i don't like the traffic you know but i like the hispanic population quite a bit you know. and i have a lot of friends here so i guess you know i don't want to be anywhere else. like i said the traffic you know i was on the phone with 500 that's always kind of in a crummy the cost of living that's really you know terrible but it's always expensive and you know i really don't like. i really don't like you know i can just seems like i'm always one of those places were like you know you have like a ton of money and fame and fortune or like you know you're down and you know that the ghettos you know. i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot i have i've been to a couple places you know book very brief in a multiverse for school i want arizona and new york in montana anthropology like you know and archaeology field trips and things like that that's what i'm doing right now. i like getting away from the city you know i was in yosemite last year in ohio in the summer for vacation that was kind of nice you know your family was really really need to see but you're busy getting away from the city i guess you're not getting away from the job getting away from the stress here. i actually studied political science and i also studied economics i'm a big kind of political you know junkie you know that begin with for a natural valentine with that kind of field of study. i was i was but i lost my job and you know that's kind of a bummer you know the last it's cheese it's only been maybe a year and a half an hour maybe two years and you know the condom got bad and the budget cuts got bad and you know i wish i was working there again. i love my job you could almost say it's virtually made for me. well i wanted to be a lawyer one time i want to be a lawyer in a and that's why i took political science and i took a double major in economics and the sad thing is the sad thing is that a you know what to get into law school to take the entrance exam called the alsace and i study for a leg really hard core you know it for about a year and i took the test and like an idiot i didn't feel right about that that day it was kind of an off-day and you know it's like going to the big game of the super bowl by just don't i don't feel like i did well and i cancel the test and so on. do i kind of regret that you know. tell me about it. i'm not really shy at all i'm definitely not shy but outgoing and me not one of these people not flamboyant you know i'll talk to people i don't mind talking to people i don't mind meeting people that's fine with me but it's not like i'm you know dinan to kind of meet anybody. sometimes when i'm feeling 10 i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but. i guess. these days you know i play guitar and i taught myself how to play guitar thank you thank you i should actually be doing more of it but i also like to exercise i'm going to die right now but my dad's been terrible time eating habits have been terrible but the exercise part is just great i love to x i love to run that's one of my best things to do for stress is the ground and they pop workout i just wish that my eating habits where we're in line we're a little bit better you know. okay. my temper could be you know definitely improved a lot you know i'm in a lot of times i i feel i'm one of these introvert types person when it comes to let you know i don't mind being an extrovert or like meeting people and like having a good time whatever we know what i'm mad i really don't want to be you no talking to people i don't like to yell i don't have to scream but i'd like to hear i don't like to fight a kind of close down a lot i don't know what you want to be left alone sometimes i tend to drag it on for longer than it should be in the wife doesn't like it too much and maybe you know i just don't i just want to talk him i just don't want to deal with it it kind of close down and shut you know. shut off for a little bit. cheese doesn't happen too often. maybe with my wife you know it'll probably be something silly who knows. who knows. the thing is i don't have a lot of guilt i don't do anything like to make me ever feel like you know that bad of a person you know i'm there are things that like you know call my nersons you know i get white lies or whatever you know what like nothing like so atrocious that makes me feel like guilty. can you give me an example of a. let's see i guess sometimes you know you know i'm very guy but you know sometimes the times you know i like to smile a girl or like you know get a girl's attention you know i don't know i never do anything about it never get the phone number you know but sometimes i like to like talk to people i guess you know. and that you wish you would handle different. well that's a good question i guess. i guess you know i always have to look the same but does not i don't ever wish to deliver to ever change it and never wanted to handle things differently i always kind of i'm pretty comfortable the way i handle things and you know i think that i could be a lot worse than like you no shouting and screaming and hitting in this and that and that's just not me you know i think the best thing to do you know it's kind of like get a lot of breathing room a lot of space and i don't wish for that to change or to handle any that differently i just don't really know what else to do you know and you know the last thing i want to do is start talking about you no feelings or any of this you know that's the last thing i want to do and so like i don't wish that i handle things like that differently in that way. tell me about your relationship with your family. well you know i'm pretty happy with my family right now you know if i'm married and we have a baby along the way which is kind of nice if some cats thank you thank you if cats and a dog a weenie dog and my mom i love my mom dearly she has diabetes which you know she doesn't control you know she doesn't control it and like it like fx4 health and nose has me worried about her and i stressing out about her and she could do so much too late for vented and she doesn't sand. you know i have a good relationship with my mom i love her dearly and actually have a good relationship with everybody i think i think i have a ton of family and friends get along with me pretty well actually you know. there are times i mean it's pretty easy for me to go to sleep actually i feel like you know i sleep like a baby the only problem i have i think is i feel like you know sometimes like you fall asleep and you have you just going to sleep and you can kind of like you know like you almost kind of looked for it is like i was falling sensation or something like that and it didn't happen that often but it happens and before the most time apart when i sleep like a really good. well right now generally i've been feeling worried and anxious and you know intense the reason why is because i see my mom right rallies today but found out my mom something she didn't tell me the whole story and i'm kind of waiting to this is over so we can i can find out what's wrong with her but you know i'm worried about her she's she's at the doctor's right now so that doesn't tell me anything good and you know i'm trying to find a job so that has me worried too and you know the baby along the way so that has me worried so i feel like you know overwhelmed with a just a lot of like you know things to do in like and. and i'm a lot on my plate in like a lot of it doesn't have anything to do with me but i have to handle it like you know so like i guess. well i keep myself distracted i keep myself busy i feel like a busybody you know the more you know it seems like it's not a good thing because i feel like i'm just adding more things on my plate so you know like one of things i do is like exercising so i have to workout everyday you know what that takes an hour that takes an hour to like you know chicken change you need to start raining in lagos to the whole thing of stretching and cooling down at 6 to take some time and then they can shower and all that kind of stuff to it takes time so it but i have to do a daily do i cope with it and that way i also cope with it to you know playing guitar but that's just more of a distraction you know what i mean keeping keeping busy that way it's just seems like it's not you know i'm working towards you know the goals you know that i need to do let you know if i find another job which i should be doing but then. in all it's one of those things were like i find that there's no good jobs i've been looking and looking like something that i do it it's just not what i want to do it just doesn't seem like i want to do is lay terrible jobs. you know it's it's. probably harder than i'm thinking about it because sometimes i feel like you know one of these things is like. i feel like it is hard but it's not i mean they're always i can cope with it you know i just got out of a kind of accepted it a lot you know i can't internalize it and like you know it's not something that's like i'm out on the street or anything like that but you know it is a worry. i've never been diagnosed with ptsd i used to work with. no. tell me about the last time you felt. man. 10 years ago the last time was really happy maybe. me nothing i feel like nothing makes me happy no more you know i learned a new song on the guitar i feel like not even happy about that you know i feel like i'm you know i work out something that kind of makes me happy no running like you know fast and working out but that doesn't make me so excited or anything like that it just makes me feel good you know so i have these these these times where i'm just you know feeling good about myself in a feeling you know but i'm never feeling great i'm never feeling happy and they were feeling like so sensationalize like you know and and and you know incredible that you know it's just another mile times where there's a few good times you know in a few bad times with a good times and never extremes you know never really good times and never really see no choices baddest x you know. well i wish this is diet would work out a little bit better you know but that's kind of hard you know cuz i'm the kind of guy who just likes who just likes you know you know why you like mexican food makes you know i'm a snack and i don't know i just feel like that could i could change i wish i could change my eating habits that way i can let you know cuz i work out so much i feel like i do so much money and so much activity that like you know that if i got my tight and check you know that was also can change you know. my my i guess my my desire to like you know get a head like right now i feel just so like the kind of me so bad and like things are so unwell that you know it's like pointless to even like you know look for these kind of jobs like it just seems like i just wish i had a little more inspiration and motivation to like to. do things. the one thing i regret is is not is not you know it's this lsat thing you know you know. not passing the test again with cuz i'm sure i could have got into it at school but then again later you know it has me thinking like do i really want to pay once you let you know law school tuition and the cost of that and then you know just to just to be power down with more work and things like that i don't know it just didn't seem like like. there is this idea of justice and and and republicanism and you know things that i really ain't here to that i fall in love with a that i don't want to get away from but it's just seems like it's a ton of work and money and just too late for the smallest percentage of success it that you know you might not be able to do in that kind of feel you might and you know it just didn't seem like like it's worth overcoming the obstacles i need to overcome. advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago. i have no idea i would have 20 years ago i would tell myself maybe. and i think i've done everything really well for myself except for the outside thing you know which i regret on one hand on the other hand you know i'm not sure if i regret cuz what the bills and all that kind of stuff i told you about and i think you know i've waited to get married and waited to have a kid you know pretty cautious about this is why i don't take drugs i don't drink i don't fight i don't do any of these things that let you know that i think that real people have him in and they really like you to ruin their life you know it's like i'm pretty happy and content with being in or the cautious you know i don't know. okay. how do your best friend describe you all my best friend i think he kind of his likes me he wishes that i would do more things with him but he works at night and you know it's one of the things i think most people not just my best friend but my wife and remind me the rest of my family so that i don't put a lot of time and attention to them and they think that i'm pretty great when you give them the time of day and my attention but i don't know if i'm really there all the time you know i don't know if i'm really you know i'm always thinking about something else i don't know if i really can give him a real you know shoulder to cry on or you know if they ask for something you don't usually do it you know but i almost feel like it's like a chore like you know legacy you know if they really need me then i'll do it you know if it's just asking for a favor i almost felt you know i do have a lot of lackluster that i have hardness i just. it's not because i hate him i feel like i'm their friend makes them somehow you know like it makes me think you know the times i think i don't want them down the aisle my friends but it's the same time i just feel like it's it's more it's not it's not it's more like a chore to do instead of a. willingness like it oh my god like i just want to help you is that it's never like that it's just something that i do because i kind of have to do you know you got to go to do things for your friends you know in the end because of your friends you know and i do like them and they probably would do it for me and i know so i just do the things you know just. what are you most proud of in your life. well there are a couple of things that i do like that i could feel good about myself you and i ran the la marathon that kind of felt good you know i've graduated from college that kind of feels good do you know what i mean but the thing is i don't feel like like that proud of myself for you know those things alone like graduated from college you know has it really made me successful you don't need me running the marathon hasn't made me sit there like half merits you know we're like the great in or may not have done it except friday but you know they're going to make stepping stones it like that i used to know life-long. benefit from

14,72,yes. i'm doing very well today i feel good today. borden indiana grew up in bloomington. i moved to la for a job working with the cdc. i've only been back twice in the past 20 years. my family is not there anymore i went back for high school reunions. it's much greener it's very green a very small. very young. wooded areas before i played in the woods when i was a kid we summon the corries i rode my bicycle everywhere and here it's a little more cement in traffic. it was it just seemed like cement at first but i loved it now and i have friends and i love being able to do so many different things and i go to the beach a lot i took up to the mountains i go camping all the time so i i love it i love it always opportunities. i have traveled quite a bit i was in the peace corps and i was in south america is in paraguay for 3 years and i traveled all three south america brazil peru chile bolivia on a suspended year in london travel through europe and i used to go to canada often i'd love to get to asia one of these days. meeting new people at the food i love trying new food in just getting a different perspective on the world and different people's outlook on the world. and because america tends to become isolated. i hike the inca trail when i was in peru that was a 5 day hike starting out of cusco we hiked for 45 days and woke up went the last morning at the sun gate of machu picchu and that was just in the most amazing experience cuz i don't need i'd seen about seen it in national geographic you know all my life so to be there and experience that was phenomenal. awesome. philosophy of mint green philosophy i minored in art and business and i got very disenchanted with it very quickly and so i decided to study what i wanted to study while i was in college and had the opportunity so that's what i wanted to do and everyone advised me against it because you can't get a job as a philosopher that i had the idea of getting my philosophy degree then going to law school and being a professor of ethics but that kind of fell apart and that's actually how i ended up joining the peace corps so it all worked out. i'm sorry. yeah. i'm sorry my alarms going off on my phone it'll die in a second okay inside still going. sorry i turned off the phone but i forgot to turn off the alarm. mexico. okay i'm sorry what was the question. my dream job gosh. writing i've done a few scripts and screenplays with a friend of mine but i don't really want to do it the hollywood thing but writing in teaching. and traveling if i could do that overseas. are going. turn turn off my alarm. i can't move okay i can't get to my first okay i'm sorry yes. i forgot it's time to go to yoga class. i'm terribly sorry about that. sorry for the interruption. i have an actual fish tank at my house tonight i do the same thing and i do that with my children when they get upset that i put them in front of a spanking is very relaxing i also try to meditate i try and and just sit down and be quiet and gather my thoughts i'd like to read and are sometimes i walk i'll take my dog for a walk. i wish i could say i was good at it but usually i i tend to have outbursts every once in awhile when things are getting too chaotic at my house and i am feeling very underappreciated i will have a burst of anger. yeah my husband doesn't appreciate that and i've never done it at work or in a social situation but at home with my family i've done it and then instead of recognizing that i'm sad about it my husband tends to get mad at me for being mad and then that escalates and sometimes i just end up walking out the door. or going to my room. i'm sorry. i usually after i have an outburst and i isolate myself for a little bit i can come back relaxed and deal with the situation in a more calm manner. i'm sometimes it's very hard. i've gotten to the point where i know just to stop in and get myself out of there and then go take some deep breaths and then really try and figure out what i'm feeling why i'm being angry why why am i being so tense. and then be able to verbalize that. well it happens a few times when i start getting it had a very tense day and things haven't gone right i tend to have outburst in the kitchen while i'm making dinner and the kids are all home and they're asking me questions about their homework or they're turning on the tv or and my husband's are bothering me about things that i just don't need to think about right then and one time i just said okay everyone out of the kitchen leave me alone get out just let me finish dinner and nobody would and i just it just had more pressure building up in building up and actually took one of the pots and just banged it against the stove really hard just like get people to pay attention to what i was saying and actually made a dent in my stove which is still there so that's that i should have. walked out sooner and taking my deep breaths before i did that. it was probably when i was pregnant with my first child. i wasn't married. i had a very good friends so i was i was 32 at the time so i was you know it wasn't young i think if i was younger i probably would have decided to have an abortion but at that point in my life i'm like okay i'm going to have this child. and i had got pregnant by the man i actually married and still married to but we'd only been dating like 3 months and i was living with a good friend of mine who had been in the peace corps with and she in so i didn't know this guy very well i didn't know if we could raise a child together i didn't know if i wanted to get married and raise a child with somebody else and my friend suggested that we raise the child together even suggested moving to costa rica to raise the child together and so i was a lot of. huge decisions that we're going to determine the rest of my life. and i made the decision based on. more common sense and practicality. but i don't regret that decision i think i made a good decision. to marry my husband and raise our child. and they're older now my my oldest is 17 he is at davinci science school and he's very much into engineering he is getting his pilot's license which i'm very proud of them for the my daughter is 15 and she loves acting she she has a boyfriend who they see just once a week at church basically and they text each other constantly she's a very very typical 15 year old and then i had a 12 year old he is extremely active and is in constant motion and always making noises but i love him dearly he is into rock climbing and there's a rock climbing gym near our house so he has a membership there so he goes over there and rock climbs almost on a daily basis. no i find it extremely difficult i wasn't my mother had a varied if my dad died when i was young and my mother kind of disconnected when that happened so i didn't have a very warm or loving relationship with my mother or growing up and i basically raised myself i was kind of on my own from a very young age i mean she was at the house but really had no interaction with her so i really didn't have parenting skills that you know most people are are raised with i know what not to do but sometimes it's very difficult and i see my friends that has you know these. very innate parenting skills is very warm and you know they're making cookies and everything's organic and they know everything and know their house is always perfect and it's like i'm just not that person so i i i tried & b i think i am a very good mother but i'm not a typical mother i think i'm more and more creative a lot of times and we do a lot of things but it's not a warm fuzzy cozy kind of thing. actually when we go camping it's more i'm more homey when i go camping then i am at home i think i'm more tense when i'm at home. but i'm trying to factory meditation and things if that's what i'm trying to become. calmer and more patient i think my patience is what i need to work on the most. and they've been an insomniac all my life i remember as a child laying in my bed watching the stars go across the my bedroom window and i haven't slept well for a long time but i realize that if i exercise and i do something with my brain intellectually during the day i have to be physically tired and intellectually tired to sleep well and that's sometimes that's hard to do and so loud house i stayed stay awake beating i'll read till midnight and then i'll try and go to sleep and usually i don't get back up even if i wake up at 3 again and things of that sort. i'll try to go back to sleep. yesterday i didn't feel so good i was i think a lot of it has to depend on the weather and was all cloudy and gray yesterday cuz i plan to when you're done working in my garden and then i'm making a butterfly garden in my front yard so i had some more planting to do and i just cooked in kind of feel like doing it so hard to put out about and wasted a lot of time yesterday but today i feel really good. i feel more positive i feel more energy. i don't know i just got a new mattress actually that hasn't really help me sleep but it was really good because i've needed one for a really long time and i was just kind of excited about being to get delivered in and set up and in that sounds like so mundane but it was you know just like i'm finally doing something positive cuz it's it's something that i put off doing and put off doing put off doing and it was like finally there in concrete and it's like i've done this task that i can check off my list but also i took the kids camping over on spring break and we just had a fabulous time and we sat around telling stories and around the campfire and making some more as and things like that and those kind of times make me very happy. i don't know i think she believes that i'm. more intellectual and smarter than i think that i am at times so she comes to me with a lot of issues she always she always listen to advice remains she thinks i give her good advice and when she doesn't know what to do so i shall ask me and then sometimes she just calls me to run things by just like to complain about because i'm sympathetic or empathetic and i just i'm just there to listen and i don't need to give her any advice so i think it's a good listener in. i procrastinate a lot. i start projects and i don't finish them so that's what i'm working on right now is finishing up a lot of projects that i started over the past few months a lot of them are really creative projects and i'm very enthusiastic about them when i when i start them and i'll get almost finished and then i don't know what happens i just completely lose interest sometimes i think it's because i'm afraid to finish them which sounds a little strange but. i'm working on that. to get this done. oh gosh. not following through on the opportunities i had when i got out of the peace corps there was a lot of things that i could go and try to go on to get my master's degree what are the grants and things so that's where it but instead i got pregnant got married and i had a wonderful job that i really liked and really enjoyed but then when i got pregnant the second time is right at a time where i had to fight for a directorship and i realized my limitations where i i couldn't be pregnant and have this child and and do everything i needed to do to get a directorship and so i really wish so i resigned and i wish i had stuck with that cuz then i would have had a much more fulfilling and rewarding in. solid career. not base decisions on emotions sometimes i am and not i have some really bad bosses the jobs were wonderful but my ego got in the way. and i would have told myself to let go of that aspect of the job that goes the the egotistical reactions that i had to the bosses and concentrate on the job and doing that really well. my children actually and also my peace corps experience was just phenomenal and people are actually really interesting that they were like an all that they actually know someone who actually did that so that that's why i always when i was a little girl my neighbor was one of the first people to go into the peace corps when it first started and i always said i want to do that one day i want to do that one day i want to do that one day and i finally got to the point where i don't have to shut up or do it so that's. that was one of my powdered experiences. okay. thank you.,0,0,3,0.93224996,0.06775006,,,,,444
15,94,turn on. yes. spectacular this is an interesting experiment. i am from middle of nowhere iowa. may 2nd of 2007 so exactly 5 years at 6 years ago and frequently like once every couple years. the weather exist so it's more extreme and then it's exciting. winter in minnesota. i took approximately. the drive-in that's that's about all it took the lights the lights took care of the rest. i really love that it's a giant concrete playground at night time so that bicycles have free reign of the streets i like all the art i love the fact that there's so many different kinds of culture jammed all together and then if you look hard enough you can find anything you really want here. oh you know the traffic the exceedingly high cost of living. i'm sure you can. not nearly as much as i would like to have been a little bit. i like not knowing exactly how things are going to go like the fact that it forces me to. deal with people to deal with situations in ways that i normally wouldn't have to. last year i got to hang out in san marcos for a little bit after i split up with my ex and then after san marcos i went back to iowa for a bunch of family stuff and then i brought my little brother to los angeles. last week managed to go on a bike ride for ciclavia. as i use basically a rolling green light the entire way down venice boulevard and so he made me made a bunch of like national news and was all over the place but the rest of us as his support group riding around on topics and stuff they we didn't bat an eye we didn't blank because it has normal for a friend that wasn't even the most absurd thing he's done lately i was just at a happy normal sunday but our group of friends is so unusual that a normal sunday for us is extreme for everyone else. i used to be an introvert but definitely an extrovert the last few years thank you los angeles. once i found the right group of friends it was easy to be social it drew me to be social extroverted even outgoing. bombastic for the first time and it stuck. if i weren't already the most relaxed guy already i would probably do things but when i'm really stressed out i do all sorts of stuff. usually i tried to enlist my friends call me doing art project. what temper. panics cuz i really wanted to make him not hate me and i mostly failed. hard on him i mostly unless i got by with a couple of scrapes on my hugo. when when that all went down i tried to talk to him but i got distracted for the very first time that day and so instead of. having my rubber gloves up i managed to take a whole bunch of words to the side of the head and fall over trash cans it was not my most graceful moment. something you feel guilty about. i feel guilty about lots of stuff i feel guilty about eating more often than everything else. because i really love junk food it's really good and i have very little food will power these to be that guy. tell me about the hardest. i'm not sure what the hardest decision i ever had to make was made a lot of hard decisions. i guess. it's very hard to leave los angeles after my ex and my best friend did a whole bunch of nasty stuff but i wasn't even that hard cuz it pushed me to do it so. tricky questions. oh you know brooke collarbone severe pain get surgery on the lc like the time. tell me about. know my numbers are important i have lived a spoiled blessed life and if i changed anything then it wouldn't be the same universe i like this universe. little brother lives here he's awesome he's actually right outside waiting for me my mom is crazy and my dad is crazy everyone else is crazy i'm pretty crazy. but. since most of the rest of them live so far away and don't have to deal with them too much relationship is positive and sparse. jackrabbits been pretty positive influence mi lately she is a magical creature. well there's a part where she's intensely physically beautiful is the part where she. manages to hit me with the best inspiration words there's the part where she. actually works on the exact things that make me excited there's the part where she pops in and out of my life at the exact right instance and then there's the part where she is 100% kind and caring all the time. all of those things are really nice but then when you add to that and compound it with the fact that. she does this all. without wanting anything in return. smitten. what a funny question how do i know them as though she's multiple people how did you know i know her through my. bicycle friends. the hard part is going to bed but as soon as i get to to sleep land time pretty much there until an earthquake hits so i can get to sleep. poorly but then i'm a pro at it so it doesn't matter. less verbose and that's about it my dark circles get slightly larger and i'm pretty much the exact same dude because i've been doing it most of my life. so stoked that i might as well be on fire. because the universe and its infant. i suppose the word is sardonic sense of humor has managed to convince me of the reality of magic in the archer city park simon's iso. as a fortunate and. vaguely aware being it's my privilege to get to enjoy more time like this. yeah my excitement is increasing at an almost exponential rate and feeling more and more inspired all the time if i could just work on the motivation i'm beside. have you ever been. not since you asked me on the phone a little while ago now. i know i used to think i had it but who knows at this point those while ago. i was very unhappy with most of my life for a very long time and then i moved to los angeles and started having fun and then the rest is ancient history. 2013. working on my shoes this morning was really nice doodling on our project that all my friends helped him put on that's that was pretty nice that's a nice feeling. awesome. a very good question i'm not actually sure i'll have some later today though. i guess i'm. susie astic i am. historic and i am. i'm going to have to say highly analytical. be nice if i could get my superpowers back would be pretty cool. like turning on some of the fancier finely-tuned and delicate machinery that chinese medicine has clued me in to inside myself. to play tough one i think the thing that i'm most proud of would probably be. i'm not actually sure. 00 all sorts of stuff i'm working on that. don't masturbate so much. what are some things that you. jackrabbit really bad puns and dessert. no problem. hi ellie. okay. what a hoot.,0,0,3,0.92269546,0.07730456,,,,,457

know not a lot. i can't afford to travel as much as i'd like to. i was an english major. i just like reading a lot at the time so it sounded like the best thing well the most fun thing to study. no not anymore. i love my job you could only say it's virtually made for me what's your dream job. it's my dream job would be to manage a soccer club. always be pretty much impossible for me. i don't have any experience in that field. very shy. sometimes when i'm feeling 10 i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got. i play music. what i do when i'm annoyed i don't know. i do what i'm annoyed. i can't think of anything i don't know. i don't think i don't do anything specifically. i pretty good i would say very good i don't lose my temper very often. i was the last time i argued with someone. i can't remember. i don't have a lot of conflicts with people i can't remember the last time i argued with someone. well it see when i was. a little kid. i was outside my grandparents restaurant and there was a robbery and i saw it i what i saw it when when the robbers were leaving. that maybe i would want to erase it from my memory if i could. well i didn't know what was happening in that moment so i didn't feel so bad at the time but i felt bad afterward because then. you're my mother was upset by my mother was there and she had to call the police and it was it was disturbing to see her you know really disturb that way but at the time it actually happened i wasn't really upset was more the aftermath of it. consideration that. i don't know. all i can think about this probably a million situations that i would have i would say i would have handled differently i can't think of one in particular. maybe. i think that when i was a kid. well i think that when i was at sea. well i have okay have a good one. i didn't marry the girl that i think that i should have married so that's a big one for me. yeah well we were together for about 4 years. and i think i just took her for granted when i just didn't commit. and them. that was a long time ago and now that it's been so many years i realized well i don't know they fight the realization but i think now that. that yes she should have been my wife that we were meant for each other are made for each other. but because my selfishness and because i just. i have this fear of commitment at the time i just felt like i didn't. they didn't do what i should have done with with a smart thing would have been. what's something you feel guilty about. well the last thing i can think of that i would say i feel guilty about was. now i feel a lot of guilt about my my friendships i'm not i don't feel like i'm as good of a friend as i could be but then at the same time i don't really know exactly what the. how i could be a better friend i just feel a little guilty that i'm not that i can't help people anyone who has a problem i can't i never feel like i can help anyone. who i know who has a problem so. how that happens every day i guess if that happens with everyone who i know and everyone. all of my relatives and all of my friends i don't feel like i can really give them anything or help them in their lives. tell me about your relationship with your. well there. it's very distant it's it's just it's very cordial and it's very. i don't know what the word is it's hot it's kept it a very surface-level i don't think that they know i don't think that my family really knows me very well at all. and i don't know them very well either not nothing to hide in a true sense. so. yeah it's. i think a lot of families are that way but it is it does bother me that mine is that way. how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep so it's very easy i sleep a lot and i. yeah i have no problem sleeping at all. no not really i would say. the way i'm now it's the way i think i've been my whole life so. you didn't when i was a little kid i slept a lot also and no i don't think i've changed much. i'm pretty down but like i said. in a way i could tell you how i'm feeling really down but then again i've always been this way so it's hard to say that it's down when it's consistently that way. yes. i would long time ago i was about 10 years old. around there about. i was just missing a lot of school i didn't want to go to school so we eventually they sent me to. to a therapist and then to a psychologist and then to a psychiatrist and. i want from there. you still go to therapy now no i haven't gone to therapy since i was a teenager. why did you stop. well i didn't feel it was helping me at all so one day i just. decided i didn't want to go anymore. affected you. well like i said it i didn't feel that it helped me. so i guess it's not enough that it affected me much. no i wouldn't say disturbing no. tell me about the last time you felt really happy. well i feel pretty happy whenever i see my nephew. and i have a. my best friend's children are i feel like their mind my nephew and my niece and i'm pretty happy when i'm around them. that's great. tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. my ideal weekend would be. i would probably be traveling i would. really enjoyed getting out of the city every weekend. it going anywhere really just anywhere out of the city. i just seen the way different people live and how people are different wherever you go i really do think people are different when you go to different places and. how they interact with you and how they see the world different food. and i also like historical places i mean to history and i and i enjoy this visiting anywhere that has some sort of. historical significance. awesome. i haven't taken a trip in a long time. the last trip i really took was i went to france a few years ago for a wedding. and i had a really good time there i had always wanted to go to paris and so i got to go to paris and then i went to a little town. what's a few hours away from paris where the actual wedding was. i knew it was really fun i think that the church where the wedding was was like a thousand years old so. that was a really cool trip. i got to know i don't have it i don't know what's what would would be considered memorable. a memorable experience. probably the most memorable experience i guess which is be. nothing in particular but but living with the girl who i just who i told you earlier that i think now that we should have gotten married. that's something that stays in my memory that's why i'm saying it's memorable because. it's it's still with me in the. it's something that i don't think you know what i know i'll never forget but it's not any particular day or any particular moment. a lot. check it be healthier. for one thing and more energetic. and the more friendly i think i am pretty friendly. but more more outgoing more more more social. those two things mainly i guess that i would like to be more and more social more enthusiastic and more and healthier. that's a good question my best friend how would my best friend describe me i think. i think he would say that i am. a very cheesy but probably say that i'm a very spiritual person. and that i'm very giving i think i'm a lot more selfish than people think i am but people think that i'm not selfish. and probably he would say there in creative also. put my advice to to myself i don't understand the question. is there anything you regret. yeah but we already talked about it. no i can't. i don't think i really believed in and being proud or in the end pride. i don't think that it accomplishments are really something to be proud of but i can't really think of. any accomplishments. anyway even if i did have something to be proud of. i can't think of any any sort of accomplishment i've had. something i did recently that i really enjoyed. well i signed karaoke with a couple of friends of mine. i don't usually do that but. yeah that was a lot of fun a few days ago. thank you. i was more difficult than i thought it was going to be just kind of had me stumped a lot and a lot of the time and i was. i think i got better after a little while and i was. at first i thought i was going to get mad because i'm not saying anything and i don't know how to answer and.,1,1,3,0.22465831,0.7753417,,,,,381
20,112,hashemite hair you see what you look like oh my god. all right now. so this picture is not based on a real woman at all. okay so when she said i'll just wait for the buttons not working and i'll come back to you okay. hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today. creative. yes. i'm doing okay it's still morning so. i'm from the east coast massachusetts. yes. i moved to la when i was a child with my parents pretty much didn't have any choice in the matter. i haven't been back to the last time i was back there was that three years ago for christmas. la's very hustle-bustle there's a lot of people that are angry and a lot of people don't care about the other person here in la and which becky is the east coast that the thought pattern is a lot different you know your neighbors are friendly to your neighbors and tammy way that you see in the street. so yeah. well since i was a kid i was fairly young at first it was rough i was getting in trouble a little bit in school but after all that surpassed i did fine in high school and stopping even took some college courses. well i love the beach and i love the mountains i like to go hiking and i like walking along the beach i just live a few blocks away from the beach so it's easy. i'm sure you can tell by my shoes. do you travel. no not at all. it's not interested i've been to mexico a couple of times when i was younger went to ensenada but other than that i'm not interested in leaving united states especially with what's been going on lately overseas. okay. actually child psychology and i was in the nursing program for a little bit but i had some problems at home which caused me to drop out. that's right. i don't have one to be honest i admire people that are doing the job that they love i mean like football players they love playing football and they get paid all that money i'll grade is that so. i'm pretty outgoing when i meet somebody at first i might be a little bit reserved because we all when we meet somebody pass judgment as to if we want to continue communicating with the person or not but once i decided i like that person or whatever i i talked a lot so. hey. yes. i like watching movies i like i used to like reading but lately my concentration level hasn't been so great so it's hard to get into a good book. not good at times i have a. some outburst every once in awhile to say depends on how angry i get. i yesterday and it was with my partner and actually be honest i don't remember what it was about it's just sometimes people can have an ugly attitude and i don't appreciate that and if i feel that i'm being disrespected or whichever i'm going to stand up for myself. at times some people may be turned off for my personality because very opinionated and i say what i say what's on my mind i do not purposely going to hurt people's feelings or anything of that nature but i won't be bullied and i won't be may i won't back down if i feel like i'm being challenged so. last year my mother died. so. i wish i handled that differently. it up to it that upset me. so. tell me about. i think i'm going to pass on that one too because that'll upset me more. that is terrible sometimes i sometimes actually falling asleep may not be a problem especially you know when you're done working and doing everything that you have to do in a day you're tired but staying asleep is a whole different thing for me because it's like i can't i get up and then i'm wide awake i'll go out and living room turn on the tv and watch tv i'm lucky if i get 3 to 4 hours sleep. are they triggered by something. maybe because i do have a lot of my mind you know thinking about bills and the stressfulness of work and in all this other stuff so that's probably a big burst part of it. but it's not difficult it's just frustrating cuz when your mind goes on overtime mode it i just affects everything your concentration your sleep you're eating. everything so. i don't look grouchy especially in the morning i'm not a morning person i like the nights but i don't like the morning that's like leave me alone until i get my first cup of coffee so other than that i'm okay. well i've been i've been depressed for quite some time and i'm still having difficulty cuz after my mother died four months later my uncle died so i had two deaths last year so i'm still reeling and trying to. get myself back together just recently i've started pursuing like interest that i used to do that i haven't done in a year because of what happened. i just i might get angry little easier i sleep alot i eat i overeat. i get tired very easily cuz i'm not getting much sleep so sometimes it's hard it seems like i'm struggling to get through the day. yes i have a psychiatrist that prescribe me medication on a regular basis. oh i was diagnosed quite some time ago probably 10 to 15 years ago and it's just something i've never gotten over i don't know whether or not you can so i've always taken the medicine. i was. arguing with everybody in my family my friends and stuff like that and i was feeling desperate and hopeless and i had attempted to take my own life years ago which caused me to be hospitalized and then they start treating me i start seeing a therapist so. well right now i'm not going to a therapist because my insurance will cover the psychiatrist and a therapist but i am working with a friend of mine who had no some avenues to go to seek help for a therapist and i don't know if that's really going to help me i mean sometimes it depends on what kind of therapist you get sometimes people just sit there and they just listen to you talk and ramble on and you're thinking my god what good is this and the other type is the type that will give you some kind of feedback as to how to deal with the emotions tools to help you deal with your emotions. tell. change it. they said i haven't been going to therapy recently just psychiatrist medication. there's been no changes really. i probably would be doing fine because i was doing great before my mom passed away i was her caregiver and. even though a lot of times i filled i felt overwhelmed or lacked patience with her i still was a heck of a lot happier. then i am now. tell. i would say when my son was born years ago. do you find it easy to be a parent. i'm not a parent anymore he passed away. so. and that was difficult as well. i'm extremely organized extremely reliable my work loves me because i get everything done that i'm supposed to get done even though sometimes i feel a little scatterbrained and. you know those qualities are are admirable and people that can keep their word and and be responsible. excuse me. oh i have lots of regrets. things that i've done in the past i'm not too happy about but you know i met somebody once in my life that had had that saying and you see it on a bumper sticker live to never regret so you know you can't go back and make changes it's too late so why you don't dwell on the situation but this is what i'm just a lot easier said than done. i'm at the advice kind of get person you know i don't really. give my friends ain't kind of advice i mean. i find most of the time people don't listen to you anyway so why bother i just state my opinion that's all. what right now i'm on a diet because of my overeating after my mom died i was a lot thinner when she was alive i just went crazy with the food and sleeping a lot and i'll sleep eat sleep to eat and so now i'm kind of like on a diet trying to lose this weight his very unhealthy for me. i think it's been a long time. actually there's really nothing because now i just keep my mind busy i haven't been to a movie in ages i don't i used to go out shopping all the time i don't now so it's been it's been quite some time since i've been content and happy with who i am and what i'm doing in my life right now. spend your ideals. my weekends like on saturday i'm usually working on sunday is usually clean up day you know do your laundry clean up the house. run some errands go shopping for food you know that kind of thing so it's not if i was younger you know it would be fun you know got clubbing or whatever but i'm too old for that now. really there's nothing that i can think of. there's nothing that i can be proud of. set a good like comedy or whatever i like to watch that. sometimes my partner might do something stupid which i like because i like make fun of them. but that's it you know could maybe go out for a walk on the beach that's it. okay. no problem thank you. bye. there's somebody talk for her or she's just talking to me really. okay.,1,1,3,0.312625,0.687375,,,,,376
21,123,"all right. thank you. are you okay with this. yeah. i'm fine. pacific grove california. the wholesale opportunities and all the stores and anything i could ever ask for. the traffic is the mood of the people and the unhealthy pace. i would see i did like culinary and i did really good in art and music. in high school. through my own will and desire to want to get involved with the music. no. open up a health practice of some sort. what made you decide to do that. changing things in my life that had an impact on myself and others for the for the benefit of health. i'm sure you can tell by my shoes. do you travel. when i have the opportunity. buying things seeing the culture relaxing not thinking about the city. well yeah i used to go to texas every every year with my dad during the summer and i always wanted to stay there and live there when i went on vacation. most likely one of these trips to texas where we would go and spend time in the desert shoot guns and ride go-karts and stuff like that. it was. i'll see y. my dad and i are not really talking that much and my mom dust away about 2 months ago. i'm sorry to hear that. thanks. definitely marsh i always been that way. i just a personality that i've grown into but learning how to adjust the sensitivity and grow out of it. sometimes when i'm feeling 10 i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got. teen. eating i like to eat that make that calms me down. not that good when i get really upset that it's usually a problem and i have to work to come myself down and sometimes i just don't get on something and i don't stop. sometimes but i've learned to control it to that extent now. when was the last time you. yesterday i was arguing about what's what kind of water we should be drinking. oh well a difference of opinion and i felt as though my opinion was very valid even though the other party's opinion was somewhat misinformed. definitely everyday is growing process i wish i would have handled everything differently every day which is what makes me grow and i tried to work toward, it would have wanted to handle things everyday little by little. okay. tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to. can't think of anyone right now. what's something you feel guilty about. find i'd i'd say not supporting my friends as much with their career choices. i'd rather not get into it. the raw food educators on youtube and raw vegan educators and the detox therapy therapy experts have been really inspirational in the past 2 months. well that they believed that the essence of all nutrition comes from the raw fruits and vegetables and this is true with many studies like t colin campbell the china study the sources of information that are that are very good and i think deserve respect based on you know real research. how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep really easy i've almost got it down to a science. what are you like when you don't say. i'm tired. i'm feeling better than i have in a long time. oh yeah i think it's due to the transition in the diet and in no way having a placebo effect that's actually you know losing them talks and some things that i've accumulated over my short lifetime of you know toxic choices with food and drugs or whatever it would be. yes i'm less tense and less irritable and i have more clarity and more control over my. decisions in my wants versus what i need that sort of thing. nope. yes to some extent. our 5 years ago. lack of motivation and. basically make my symptoms were paralleling that of depression. loss of appetite loss of motivation not wanting to do anything not wanting to be social at all having fear of social situations and the main for 5. no. i believe i overcome to chapter in my life that was the the doctor you know taking control my health and experimenting with drugs and i just sort of took another route which was alternative and i started juicing more and just trying to listen to maybe what i needed with help of the internet and nutrition experts and stuff like that. yes. can you tell me if. i believe therapy is useful because. without looking inward or having somebody to help you to that it's very hard to readjust to some of these problems that you can have that will just resume in the subconscious and tell you you know it has an outburst is basically therapy will help an overall health and mental health i believe fairy. last night i made a really great vegan dinner with no meat tacos and cheese and guacamole and had a couple of my friends over and they really liked it a lot of almost converted them. i would say. you know i'm trying to listen to my inner conscious more than what my brain wants me to do like my brain likes caffeine and sugar or as you know my body needs something other than that. apple. it's very very hard it's a daily process. tell me about a time when someone made you feel really bad. i was handling money for a business partner and they ended up short and i was to blame but it was actually my formula crunching the numbers that it made it short but they he was unaware of the change i make the formula so the blame is on me that i may have took money and i automatically felt bad about that because of my uneasy my uncertainty to the change of formula. is there anything you regret. no. 20 years ago i was two years old 10 years ago is 12 years old i would tell myself to. to start eating raw fruits and vegetables everyday. as calm and. sad maybe smart talented. i really enjoyed going to the wholesale food market in downtown los angeles. can you tell me about that. lots of food at great prices you can eat and feed a whole family for a third of the price is going to a normal supermarket. so i really get a lot of enjoyment of teaching people how to maybe better themselves especially food-wise what they're eating. what are some things that usually put. eating and i'm watching a really good tv show. okay. i'm insightful i cannot i can adjust to people. i don't know i guess i'll skip that question for now. i'm most proud of. that's in my overall situation with where i'm at right now i could have never imagined that i'd be in such a fortunate situation. that's so good to hear. because i want everything i need. sharing your thoughts with me. i think she's done.",0,0,3,0.54728454,0.4527155,,,,,400
22,137,"can't you see me right now. okay. hello. yeah i am. good to moderate. los angeles. yeah i'm from. just a lot of different kinds of people and i love the weather most of the time and great creative seeing i'm really into music so it's a great scene for that. i don't like driving i don't know who does right it's just it's just such a drag and getting from point a to point b is just the daily need and it doesn't get any easier too many people too many people. can't see your shoes. yeah when i can i want when i can afford to. being somewhere else not having to drive usually must places have better public transportation just mean i'm a culture junkie i like experiencing different types of cultures so that's. how many places i've been to like mexico and italy it it's i want to go to more places i want to go to japan. so that'll be interesting and usually this is my family my mom sometimes my girlfriend sometimes my brother and we just yeah we go to italy we spent two weeks there though i was cool. yeah. living next to the best gelato shop in italy. we were we were in florence spent a spend a week in florence that was great big very good culture there as well. art. studied film and digital media cuz i make music and i want to learn how to make music videos so it's someone trying to get into. yeah yeah i mean i need to get a camera that's the thing but i've been with my main focus is music i studied film but my focus is music. can you tell me about. sure i've been playing music and playing guitar keyboard bass drums for about 12 years now and i do production and songwriting an indie rock band. that's a great website i highly recommend it and it's it's mine so. shake it up. international rockstar music producer and filmmaker director. probably are going. i'm just feel like it's the way to get the most out of life talking to people and learning about them and having them learn about you and care about you it's a territory. yeah. i do meditation. and. it's not really hard cuz it's fun and it it relaxes me and helps me focus the same time. which i know that that was a huge epiphany for me that you can relax and focus at the same time cuz they're only when i'm relaxing i'm tuning out i'm focusing on something else but to be able to come by in the sensations was yeah i've been doing that for about 3 months now so. yeah it is. almost to get a tax sometimes others things that should be said that i that i don't just because you know it's like you're opening up a can of worms maybe one of your friends for example i got a problem with him but they don't have a problem with him necessarily so you can do anything to them and i've had to deal with that in the past sort of a awkward social situation but. yeah i make deal. probably argued with the guitarist for my band we had a falling-out we're not going to be in a band together and we're still friends so at least it's that but it was just basically about creative control the project and how we're going to prioritize it and in our lives and. you know we just our priorities weren't the same and i got very upset so that was the end of that. i felt good that it was definitive that it was no choice has been made on both parties also regretful that you know he didn't feel the way that i want him to feel about it which was excited about the project so. the fact that he wasn't really in it kind of pissed me off but i got over it any i got some other people that are really really excited to be working with me even honored so you know i'm gone. thank you. i don't know i don't really i don't really have any regrets like that at the moment i can't really think of any. when i was in high school i cheated on my girlfriend i don't think it would mean anything it's time. but i did it. i regret it but i. you know you know life happens you make some mistakes. selfishness. being young and thinking it would matter. you know. thinking. you know you only live once and. you know for me it's probably for the best ultimately cuz you know i love my current girlfriend and i would never do that to her so. that was that was years ago but and she was a nice girl she didn't deserve that so. i got it. shit genzyme. i guess whether to go to college or not cuz i had some projects going in la that i didn't really want to shut off a dab and going get a manager we were playing out a lot and i wasn't sure if i wanted to keep that going or go to school and start over and i made the decision to go to school in santa cruz and and start a new life there for four years and. it was difficult decision but i'm glad i did send that a lot of people a lot of people i'm still close with today that and we work on stuff together and all that so good. i agree that is good thank you. maybe i wish i could forget getting spanked in the parking lot when i was 4 by danish babysitter you know on the abuse scale it's pretty low but it was somewhat humiliating and i i don't forget so. have a pretty vivid picture of it and. i'd be happier if it wasn't there. positive there a sportive give me a hard time sometimes because they don't think that i keep things in perspective and terms of, to support myself even though i do it's just so you know i have a more long-range picture than they do and i have faith in myself and. creative projects that i make so. yeah there's a bit of tension there just cuz they expect certain things from me and i expect them as well but i just have a different way of going about it than they might prefer. but they're sweet people. how do i cope with them i do know what they're lovely people at their core you know cope with them cuz i love them i just. no x i'll just go off on my own for a while. and you know take a breather or whatever and they have everyone makes you mad sometimes so. how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep. challenging. i just i try doesn't work. sometimes i have to take medication for it at to take ambien something like that. i'm someone who sleeps in late so i always get at least six or seven hours if i have to wake up early for something i get nauseous sometimes i'll throw up in the morning yeah i've had jobs where i wake up and. you know vomit while i'm brushing my teeth it's horrible. it does suck its kind of something i'm worried about you know i kind of need to get some part-time work while i'm not you know getting a steady payflow for my music production so. yeah it's pretty rough. got some stuff i need to get over i'm not really sure how. just not feeling good getting nervous when you know there's something stressful like a stressful work environment or just something that it doesn't sit well with me like being in a. yeah i rushed and you know stressful work environment just unless it's about something that i care about you no like music or the arts it's just very hard to give a shit frankly like and you know i try to psych myself into giving a shit and it just makes me sick you know maybe i'll have a red bull or something and your body doesn't want that in the morning it just like my body rejects things and. yeah. okay. i've been feeling okay. very very reflective for contemplative now there's going to be some changes and it's going to be. some new people in my life some new people in my band and i'm going to try to push myself but try to stay grounded at the same time cuz you know i expect more for myself it's just pissing me off when i get mad at me. basically feel like i'm shiting all over myself my body sitting on me anyway just by being so so. shity. yeah. no. yes. i was diagnosed. 12 years ago i haven't been in therapy since. they gave me zoloft and i don't like it. made me feel worse than i do in the shittiest moments i was telling you about it it made me feel numb. i don't want to feel numb i want to feel everything even if it sucks. being forced to. this private school they thought i was acting up i thought i was up at a kid i think i was just being a kid so. yes i do. well i haven't been in in 12 years but i do think that it might be helpful for me in the future. can you tell me about that. i thought you weren't a therapist that's a typical therapist question right there. well yeah. i kind of want to go back to therapy and might help might help me buy some solutions maybe maybe it's not a therapist any maybe it's a life coach i have no idea but. i'll be seeking help soon. yesterday. i was watching a movie with my girlfriend and i looked over at her and smiled at each other and it was great. yeah. very honest. sometimes brutally so but i'm a good guy i think they're my friends all think i'm a gay guy funny. open minded. i guess that's what i'm working on which is trying to improve my discipline and try to work through. my body rejecting shittiness of the world. it gets better. stay in shape gets harder the longer you wait. give up on your dreams keep doing what you're doing. my music. you're welcome miss talking to

23,147,start up a virtual human who will chat with you for a bit and then when she's done she'll let you know and i will put the. okay sounds good. yes. i'm okay. i'm from here originally los angeles. i like the weather. and my family's here which is why i'm here i've moved away for awhile i like that there's a lot of even though everyone says there's no culture in la there is a lot of culture there's theater and film and lots of museums and things like that all different kinds of people i like the diversity. well i don't like that i had to move back into my will so starting a new career starting over in my career it said that's not really something i move back cuz my dad was sick. so. thank you thank you. i'm here but it also means i live with my dad and my brother who are like hoarders and ridiculous. acting theater. yeah yeah i am. i'm an actor right now i'm doing a a theater show and auditioning and taking some classes and that sort of thing. well my parents are both artsy people and i grew up around it and for a long time i was singing and then i was went to study musical theater and somewhere along the line they realize that acting was more my bag than singing i suppose but i still do both. now i don't. i don't usually have trouble talking to people i'm pretty friendly i can get along with most people people usually tell me their secrets within 5 minutes of meeting me how much i feel like is mark of an extrovert. i took a bath or read a book go out with my friends. go to the theater. sometimes my work is very relaxing so sometimes just like singing a song or and he's not going for a walk. yoga. things that makes me mad. injustice i can be very righteously indignant i suppose. people who don't see those things that people who have like entitlement i think entitlement incentive privilege that can make me mad yeah. it depends i usually a lot of times it's i argue my case i guess all right i call my best friend usually and complain talk to her about it. pretty good pretty good i don't have too much of a temper. like a real argument or like a debate. if it was a real argument probably would be my ex-boyfriend and we just argue about why we broke up stupid things like that. i think i was kind of. over it by then but it wasn't times. that's why i felt really happy. was. really happy. probably hanging out hanging out with friends the other night had a good time. my best friend would describe me as an open book she often makes fun of me for like just telling everyone everything she would describe me as. compassionate and having a strong sense of who i am. i think yeah she also said she would describe me as not having like a good sense of social norms sometimes probably that's something that she. make fun of me for because i do just like tell everyone everything and don't realize that i have like holes in my clothes and things like that but nothing i think that we have a very good relationship. yeah yeah it has it's not terrible trouble but but yeah it's got me in trouble for sure. i haven't. no but i think i had it. but i never went to a doctor cuz i had a i had a traumatic situation where somebody injured me and i when i looked up ptsd later i realized i felt like i had all of the symptoms of like going back in a situation like that i would get panicky and it was very i held onto it for a really really long time i think i think that i did have it but i just i don't know cuz i never i never saw anyone about it. sometimes yeah certain physical things with that part of my body can be a trigger or it happened in a in an acting class so sometimes certain teachers if they criticize in a certain way i start to i start to panic even if they're totally right and i know they're right and like it's something that someone else could tell me and i'd be fine with it sometimes it'll make me a little upset or panicky. well i mean my dad is sick so not great. but but considering not terrible. i've been having bad dreams. apps like stress dreams i think having to do with my dad. i getting kidnapped and my teeth falling out things that if you look them up always say like there's something out of your control she's slick exactly what it is so. it's not the best but it's just dreams at least so. which way. easy very easy. i am tired and irritable goofy i get really goofy. yeah. i. and fairly non-judgmental of other people like i stay open-minded i can make most people laugh funny creative. i. that is some of the best ones i'd say. i love meeting new people and seeing new things and learning and just getting out of the routine i like staying in hotels i like most things about traveling i even i even like flying i like all of it. well i just finished eighth or a couple months ago going up and down the east coast and then across the u.s. send performing for kids all over yeah and then we ended up here in la. yeah yeah it was great as a good time. i think we. we went to. the hot springs the naturally occurring hot springs in colorado and that was really nice i was a nice way to unwind. a lot of people i i would say my dad comes to mind certainly my godmother is a huge positive influence in my life as well. my best friend my best friend from high school i think i set a few of my best friends from high school and college that i kind of grown up with and become who i am with them. small things sure. i regret. the way that i dealt with. a friendship that was ending once i regret committing to certain people that have dated. but nothing huge i tend to go well i won't do that again but i don't spend a lot of time like being upset about things i've done in the past. stand up for yourself. don't date felons. i think that i. i don't have any trouble standing up for things that i believe in but sometimes i have trouble standing up for myself i think i i really internalized the idea of like you know women being too needy or or i don't know those kinds of things and then and so as as an adolescent and growing up i felt like well you didn't you just shouldn't need anything or you're needy and it took me awhile to be able to like a voice what i want what i needed from other people and be okay with that and still something to work on. i'm glad you think so. i could question. my friends and family. and. add my talents i would say. yeah yeah my ability to take situations and. take bad situations and continue and make the best of everything. all right. thank you. goodbye goodbye.,1,1,3,0.2355852,0.7644147,,,,,335
24,148,okay now i'm going to start at the root. okay. hey. are you okay. yes. fine how are you. i watch california but now i live in west la. i love the sunshine of the palm trees i love that you're 30 minutes away from everything straight city. the traffic is terrible. best early child development. yeah actually i teach children how to be safe in a traffic situations. jumper dream job is to be a filmmaker that's what i want to do i want to die doing that job making movies. well when i was in high school i did a lot of drama theater productions and i just love everything about film so once i had the opportunity to actually make a film because i wasn't getting any work as an actor i just got hooked i just love making feel. last time i made a film just this last october made it short film. it's about three people that connect together they're completely unrelated but they get to a retreat where they realize that their problems are bigger than what they imagined originally. thanks. really mad. it really mad i you know i guess what makes me really mad as when my daughter acts stupid at school when she does not do her work and she doesn't pay attention and i have to get phone calls home and letters home and emergency parent conferences that's what makes me mad. yes sucks she's one of the smartest kids in her school. no it's it's it's very difficult because a lot of things in yourself that you find a negative go to them and it's like you're fighting against yourself trying to change yourself but you know that little person is you you know * 152 deal with that but other than that it's okay but it's being a parent is never easy. the hardest thing about being a parent i would say is trying to give that little person so much life experience so that they don't make mistakes or so that they don't get hurt and you want to give it to them and you want them to just accept it right away but then they don't so it gets very annoying sometimes that you know what's coming and you give them the info and they don't want to take it they want to find their own way and watch them get hurt and it's sad and then they want to come in your life. i tried to tell you but you can't be mad at them because everybody learns their own way. yeah i guess for a while when you think about it when you watch them go through their struggles it's hard to watch but it's a necessary motion of life children have to learn the way they want to learn cuz once they get it they got it so however they get it as a pair of your happy they got it. all the love the children bestow upon you is great they yeah they let you know love you and all especially my daughter she always wants give me hugs she always wants to talk to me she always wants to be around me she always tells me i'm doing a great job when does she know about a great job she's only seven but you know they have that unconditional love and you just can't help but feel like a good person for having the children tell you that you're a good person so i like that. i got there you know like albert einstein said it best that our technology has exceeded our humanity and there's so much technology out their kids are learning so fast it's almost like they're already little adults but they're missing the steps to being a child they missed going outside they miss learning about things naturally rather than just going to youtube are you know wherever facebook and in getting it so fast and they don't know what to do with all this information and they just have to fight through all that info and they it's not organic anymore children growing up these days it's not organic it's sped up its pushed and it's just so hard for them to figure out who they are in this world so that's what's wrong. me cook just breathe in breathe out or i'll just walk away from the situation. argued. i argue with my fiance couple months ago about. gosh i forgot i forgot i don't remember. it was petty yeah they didn't last long cuz she's like me she doesn't like to argue about stuff would like to take care of stuff as it happens and that's it. my fiance. elk me we met when i was working at at a charter school but at a recreational center we met there and we talked we hit it off we didn't see each other for the entire year and then we reconnected and we went on a date and it was great ever since. my family were pretty close my brother lives in colorado and my sister lives in oklahoma i have a dad that lives in a neighboring city where i am as close as we can be with the distance and certain choices that my family have made over the years you know being far away but my immediate family like you know my fiance and my daughter like we're close and it's great. i don't travel enough but i have traveled a couple of times within the last 5 years i just came back from new zealand so that was a great experience. i enjoy meeting new people that's the biggest thing about traveling i like seeing new things i like just immersing myself in different cultures and situation and i like just being away from it all that's good too. well i went to new zealand not too long ago and i stayed there for a week i learned about celsius cuz you know here we have fahrenheit and that was fun i learn how to play cricket i learned how to get myself out of a capsized kayak and i learned that they have a lot of lamb lamb is good i like lamb but they have a lot of land in their sufi food i can eat but they do have really great chocolate chocolate is so good and ice cream was good too and other people who are really really nice they say it was a very special time for me to go there was great and they accepted me i love that and yeah can't wait to go back. yes it was. some of my best qualities energetic a very personable of intelligent i am easy to get along with i work pretty hard and i'm very slow to getting upset about things. no. no. it's fairly easy. i guess i get pretty moody you know i could be a little little snappy at people when i don't sleep well when i have lack of sleep but once i get some sleep in me i'm okay. no no no changes no. you know he would say that i'm pretty funny lacks about a lot of things i enjoy life as much as i possibly can good friend to have around and always ready and eager to help. things that usually. just waking up in the morning it's always a great thing i love ice cream that's always good i love laughing if somebody's laughing especially my fiance cuz he has a great then that puts me in a good mood. thank you. and that's what i want to do i definitely want to get into acting and really work it and get some really good rolls so he's going to positive influence he stayed out of trouble he's maintained a good working relationship with people and he's always positive and very super helpful and very encouraging. oh we went to junior high school and high school together so he's my best friend. yeah. yes it is. wow there's so many. had a nice bag of m&ms and we have went to a play and there were two girls that were a couple of rows down that you know we didn't particularly care for but you know that's how kids are they don't know how that you know they say they don't like somebody but you know anyway but we got these m&ms and wilder it was dark we start throwing m&ms and hit them in the head with m&ms and then we came to school like 3 days later and we were summoned and there was a mock trial to get. so we were able to get ourselves off on like the entire group had found us not guilty of the crime and but then we got in trouble anyway because our teacher just wouldn't allow us to not get in trouble so we had to clean up the yard for like 2 days. oh man you name it all of scuba diving i've only done it twice but i love it when i get back into it like traveling i love exercising i actually like working out now i used to think it was a chore but now i'm really really getting into it that i love watching movies you put me in front of a good movie and i'm a happy camper so about it in the family. eric rhett. you know what i think i probably regret not going up to will smith when i had the chance. yeah will smith was coming up the street and i saw him and i got so nervous i jumped in the bushes and i didn't meet him my boss of the time thought it was really funny but i just i wasn't ready to meet him yet so but i think i regret meeting him. advice would you give yourself time. advice i would give myself 10 or 20 years ago i would probably say that when my gut told me to do something i should have just went on ahead and did it rather than sit and analyse it you know days weeks months later if i feel it in my gut i should go for it so go with my gut more. really happy. really happy i had a film festival that i was putting together and things were so intense we things were going wrong but then things are going right but then once the people came and packed the house i was really happy that we had a packed house at this stuff in front of school so this is about a month ago. let's see i think right now at this point i'm most proud of putting a short film together with a minimal budget but it has amazing actors it has a great storyline and i didn't think it could be done but it's done or close to being done and i'm proud of that i was able to get it done i think i could walk away happy knowing that i gave it a really good shot and i think this movie is probably going to take me in the rest of my film crew buddies to higher heights. oh really. all right well what was your name again. ellie goodbye. that was awesome. no.,0,0,3,0.93056315,0.0694369,,,,,328
25,151,okay. yes. fine. san fernando valley. i'll i really like the culture of going to museums and being able to go at night and having lots of people around. it's spread out a lot and it's a pain in the ass to have to drive everywhere and that have a good public transportation system. i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot and that really like to go camping but i don't really travel. i think i might have been around 6 months ago i went on a trip with a geology class. yeah it was fun. i think it's tough to say. well i think the first time i went camping was probably really memorable i went to death valley and i got to see a lot of really cool things and hang out with my friends at night. philosophy. yes. i don't know i think it just sort of happened i wanted to be a journalist for a really long time and then i kind of grew disillusioned like that and i liked all the different ways are all different things i could do with philosophy. i don't know but i really like children and i really like. cutting their behavior so i think something along those lines might yet. i think i'm generally pretty outgoing i can't be shy on my family but when i'm around friends and stuff i i think i'm pretty friendly. i'm a lot of times i watch tv or read. i think i'm pretty good i don't really get mad i try to think about other things if i start getting mad or i just started trying to focus on my breathing. the last time i argue with someone else probably with my boyfriend and i'm having trouble remembering what the last thing we argued about was. i think it was i wasn't feeling very well and i was having trouble deciding whether i wanted to go to his department's end-of-year party and he was getting frustrated which i thought was very inconsiderate cuz i wasn't feeling well to begin with. well i felt like he wasn't really taking my feelings into consideration and i really hate when he gets stressed out or i gets angry easily because i just see necessary and it stresses me out. i think a lot of times when my oldest youngest brother when my oldest little brother does something wrong i tend to be harsh with him we're not as close as my sister and i or my youngest brother and i and so he tends to be hostile back and i think that if i were little bit more gentle might be easier to communicate with him. when i was 19 i came home. travel party i think around 4 a.m. on a sunday morning and my. get really mad at me and yelled at me and said a lot of that very nice things and then he didn't speak to me for about a year. i want my relationship with my mom is a lot better now that i don't live at home i used to be really frustrated with her all the time cuz she has a really quick temper but i think now that i've got a little bit more just so i can see that she does the best she could. and i love my siblings i again my little sister and i get along really well she's 4 years younger than me and when. when she was around 12 and i was around sixteen was really difficult cuz she a really harsh time for her and she was always moody and i wasn't in a place to be patient with that sort of stuff so we fought all the time but we don't anymore and that's really great and. we get along okay with my my older little brother who's 15 and i think i'm going along pretty well with my youngest brother who's 12. one of the first not the first part one of my first varsity professors and i really loved her classes and it was really good i'll being in class with a professor who really cared and who really engaged people that was really motivating since not all my classes were like that. i think it's pretty easy i mean sometimes i have trouble going to sleep but i thought that it's i think it's usually harder for me to wake up in the morning. well i'm really tired i can get grumpy but i think usually i'm just. groggy. good i'm a little anxious about. about getting a job and i'm going to be taking for my school about it's only one class so a lot of free time. well i mean it's not the end of the world if i don't get a job but i know that i will eventually so mostly i think i just try not to think about it too much and i tried not to be pessimistic. no. no. well i think last time i felt really happy i. went to a party with my boyfriend matt and does apartment party and i wasn't you know i knew a couple people they are so i felt comfortable but i love that also able to meet new people there a couple kids there a special on the pool and a couple of drinks and ate some food and it was fun. i'm sure probably say that i'm smart. pretty intellectual i love to read and to watch. really like series films and tv as you're probably all state on fun cuz we like to go out and have fun a lot. well i can be really just organized and the packets me in trouble sometimes it will so that's a major loan then and procrastinating. tell me about a time when someone. i got into a little bit of trouble of few months back and have to go to court and was given 60 some hours of community service and of course i procrastinate and i'm doing that so i have to show up to court again to get an extension and the judge was very mean and he didn't seem as she yelled at me but it didn't seem like he gave it much thought it seemed like it was just a little less talk speech he gave everyone that he thought needed some yelling at so i understand cuz that's his job but it was. not great for me cuz i wasn't i was really anxious in that situation. well i would have been 12 + 2. i think. i think i would have told myself at 12 not to be so hard on myself and not to be so hard on my parents cuz i think i was a little selfish and self-involved ii. i can't really think of anything i regret how i treated my mother when i was a kid but everyone does that and i do regret a couple of semesters ago i didn't do so well in school and i got a few w switch i now have to work to get off on my transcripts. i think so i am i think i wasn't focusing in school at that time and i didn't see any counselors at school or anything so i definitely couldn't find that. i think i probably spend my ideal weekend sleeping on saturday and then going hiking or maybe just going to the duck pond by my house and feeding and jackson picking some oranges and then maybe going out to breakfast sunday and just like window shopping. maybe watching a little bit of tv. well-met youngest brother is autistic and my mom and dad were always working when he was growing up i'm 10 years older than him so and being the only size of us took care of him which made me really really patient because he was a handful but i'm really proud of how she turned out and. and how close we are.,0,0,3,0.5980677,0.40193233,,,,,488
26,155,get out my ass shadow. okay. hi i'm ali thanks for coming in today. yes. i'm pretty good at drinking. maryland. yes. 85. yeah yeah it is long time. i don't know i'm not as often as i like. out of work so you know the money issue. yeah. maryland is different it in so the comparison is. the only comparison is that they're both cities but maryland has its flavor in la has its own flavor so they have unique you know characteristics about themselves. i moved to la because i was living in hawaii and i was out of money and i just got enough for plane ticket i'm coming stay here in a hotel until i found a job which i did really quickly anyway so that's why i came here i didn't want to go home i decided to come here and just start over. i am i am. it was really easy just did it. i like i like ellie's whether i like the different areas in los angeles county west la east la i like southern california you know. so you know like the people but yes i like them the. attitude you know the la attitude so yeah. i don't like i don't like some of the policies with regard to the smoking you know i really wish that the government would crack down on smoking on the streets make it like usc yeah. i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a. no not outside of but getting on the bus and things like that. i was studying to be a nurse. yeah. i wanted to have a job that pays well but afforded me the opportunity to use my service gift so yeah. no i had to put that put that on the side and i want to get a business degree now. yeah my dream job is. is 2. create new technology. can you tell me about that. other than to say i would like to create something that will change the world like steve jobs with his iphone. yeah. i am it depends on the situation but i'm more outgoing. i do tend toward the little shyness from time to time. what i do is i'll go to the movies. i went to the movies probably like maybe 5 weeks ago. yeah. well i had an argument recently not really argument but a disagreement with a woman at my church who is over this particular department that i'm in and it's a volunteer position i use my administrative assistant more executive assistant skills to to i do minutes for meetings that i cover and until then i have to produce the minutes and send them to everybody and things like that and this person is micromanaging me but not micromanaging the other admin assistant who did not get her block of people into this particular meeting so the meeting should have been comprised of a hundred people but we have like maybe 30 even 3020. yes so now she doesn't know that i realize you know that part of it so there was a little bit of a argument and but again not a argument but a disagreement and when we talk again i will point out to the person that's over both of us that there is a disconnect and the energies she's investing in me is unprofitable for what we're trying to achieve. that does not sound good. well a little attacked. you know so. it depends on i'm very good at controlling my temper it's you know there are places where you can allow your temper to come out even though it might not be appropriate and then there are other places where if it comes out then you shot yourself in the foot so i'm pretty good at controlling my temper. yeah. i don't have any situation recent that i can think of. probably say just dealing with a neighbor instead of responding to the neighbor just ignore the neighbor all together so i wish i'd done that differently. yeah. thankfully. i've not had to make that type of decision in my life as yet. i have what i do in my life and then and you know in my. going forward you know everything that i've done and everything that has happened i. accept it as something that has to be to get me to go for it i am a born again christian and so i know that that god is sovereign over my life and also that according to his word the bible says that everyday of our life is written in his book so events and circumstances i feel that i feel they are ordained by god not obviously i'm not going to jump into a burning fire or do anything ridiculous but. i feel that things that have that have happened even if i've dealt with them the wrong way it's god's his total sovereignty has control over that and it will work for my good so that's how i feel. i have all brothers and so i'm not really that close with my brothers. and my mother. say that again. people that have grown up with neighbors from when i when i was younger that i was close to different friends that i've had along the way friends who are more like family so yeah. they've had positive influence. that's i get i sleep too well. so i sleep well every night. normal but i my normal i've been feeling my normal. no. no. no. that was really something happened. i was able to participate. with my church on sunday with i was a pentecost it was pentecost sunday meeting it was 50 days after the resurrection of jesus christ and so i was able to participate in a prayer session that we had at my church and i thought that was really made me very happy. that i'm smart they would say that i'm smart that. that i handle difficulties very well. and then i dress well. i don't want to change anything i do want to just be a better me so be a better person so i am working on listening better communicating better and and accepting my. weaknesses better as well as my strengths. no. that's a good question i would have i would have told myself to. to do what i know to do to do what i know that which is right and. i can do what i know is right and let everything else let the other chips fall where they may but to do what i know to do is right and they go forward. i am very proud of the fact that i don't give up. bye and thank you see you all. thank you. i'm deaf.,0,0,3,0.5201719,0.47982815,,,,,492
27,156,no hair is all messy. doug and she's going to start. okay. hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today. yes. i'm fine thank you. detroit michigan. yes. i moved to la myself in 2007 but my family came here many more years ago more like 40 years ago. how often do you go back to your hometown. i don't go back to detroit anymore. i really don't like the weather and i really don't have any reason to most of my immediate family is out here in california. compared to a. completely different. for me detroit was just very cold it wasn't the best for my personality i prefer la more open space warmer climate warmer people just a different different vibe that i that i like better. after my husband and i relationship ended i have family out here so i thought it would be easier to start over here than some of the other places i have lived or just stay where we were at. extremely easy i came out here every year to visit while i was in college so i was extremely used to it plus i had also taken 6 months out of off of school and lived out here and it went to school out here so i was completely used to it. like i said the weather is number one and just less crowded it's more open space it's a comer friendlier vibe less rushed. this morning would be one and when i drive to traffic in certain areas it can be but in general. there's not a lot but i don't let's like i guess the overall threat of earthquake but that's isn't really that much of a factor cuz it rarely happens. the price of real estate that's another one that i don't necessarily like. i'm sure you can tell.. i can't see your shoes i can't see your shoes at all. so i don't travel as much as i used to. but i have traveled worldwide. new experiences. well i used to be an international flight attendant and then later i traveled through my work as a cruise line and as an international sales account executive so i traveled a lot of different places and. how to say they were all pretty much enjoyable cuz you know there's different cultures different things to see do learn enjoy experience. my experiences i was saying. europe visiting more so i've also visit it in south south america yes cuz our cultures are so very different. i was probably say more shy in general compared to people who i know are really really outgoing although i've had them describe me as outgoing. what i'm feeling 10 i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got. i like to read i like to walk or power walk or hike. listen to music. i'm very good at controlling my temper. oh probably when i was married with my husband many years ago it could be many things i don't even know a specific but just anything in general pretty much could turn into a debate argument with him. it could be it could be your choice of. some of the instances when i might have been with him and i you don't got emotional or let it bother me that he made such a big deal of something rather than just you know saying it is not something to respond to perhaps but it was always be where you were also pushed to answer so you know you can always just say ignore a person there cuz many times it's just a matter of ignoring situation and it doesn't escalate but some people. you know what don't respond to the so-called norm if you ignore it they'll just so you know deescalate but that's not always the case i taught middle school kids and you can try call message with him but that doesn't always work but you always have to use the teacher maintain you know your professional demeanor so you can't really even when you know the kids do something outrageous or possibly dangerous to themselves or the kids so. well if i could be. several. my guess it is susan in. long as my mom deciding to let a relative have surgery that you know the outcome was uncertain it could go either way and in that case she died so. i know that's a pretty hard decision cuz you don't know but you also know if you don't but it could be very serious outcome for them as well. what about nevada or something that you wish you could erase her memory. oh many different things that could occur you know in life you always are second-guessing things that you might could do but they also can be learning experience is so is it necessarily a good thing to erase them you know if you can look at is positive sometimes people can have a strong reaction and don't really look past the impact of the event cuz there might be something that. you can gain from that. but there are a i grew up in a home of dysfunction so there was. just domestic abuse you know and. there were many incidents is so you can't just say only one cuz there is lots of traumatic things but it also would have been a different outcome and say learning to deal with some of the things that occur in life is an adult that sometimes i see among the acquaintances or friends that have not had really strong experiences fall apart or just have very very difficult times dealing with so. you can listen you know you can and i cuz i understand that not everybody's had the same experience you know you can walk them through levels of understanding and you know as you know someone you have a balance of background information on which to help them pull from in to see that you know things will progress in a better way knowing that this isn't like the end of the world or is terrible as it seems that it could be and you can also relate other experiences of things at work worse or you know seem to be and of course is always in general i mean when you look at all the calamities in the world. you know most of those things aren't affecting us or the people that we know here. so that provides as perspective that you know can pull someone out of there. i don't necessarily say self-absorption but the seemingly intensity of their experience right at the moment. well we have a good relationship day for the most part there are different levels of stress and trauma that some of my siblings have experienced so it is made them interact with life and people you know more intensely than others some of not had. as much. experience in life that will help them deal with things you know in a different way so it's always evolving and i walk and positivity as a lead of you know the way i respond to try and engender more positive response from them rather than feed sometimes the very strong reactions are responses or any reactions that they may have. pardon i didn't i didn't hear you could you repeat. my mother different teachers friends. can you tell me about. well my mother is always been a very calm person for the most part easy-going even though she's experienced a lot of negativity i've had teachers that have been very. talk positive and proactive and have you know taught independent thinking and techniques to rise above some of the things that were occurring and just very close friends that you know i would see handling situations sometimes more much more more difficult you know dealing with things so. it depends for the most part it's you know pretty good it depends if i'm dealing with a lot of things or studying or you know trying to get more hours in the day cuz me to get things done then you know it's less but in general i don't have a problem sleeping it's just if i make myself stay out stay up because there's more stuff that i want to get done. i've been feeling okay but less you know stressful and general it goes in general cuz i've got several projects that i'm working on so but in general good. like i mean. in particular i mean i just seems less stressful as i get more stuff done and the stress comes from sometimes are being a lot more things to do in a short. of time but you know reorganizing some of the things that need to be done you know can smooth it out. have you ever been to. no i haven't but i know it's something that a lot of say veterans are particular how people have. i have not know. well there's several i guess. and happiness comes in small or large things but in general everyday everyday everyday every moment to me is i mean every day every morning is great wonderful you know your happiness as far as big celebratory kinds of things i don't have big highs and lows like that i think it's something that should be on your continuum you know it everyday it can be a really great meal it could be a great view it could be you know a moment shared with someone you know so. this should be an even on an even keel. as perseverant you know i will continue for sand and positive upbeat. is there anything you regret. maybe not doing things differently when i were younger or like spending my money differently or or spending my time you know a little bored differently but that's hard to say it's like okay as your kiddos or you can see you know you could have done some things differently. instead of buying the house i did what if you know waited and bought another one of me things like that. i would have made myself moved california sooner and i would have. instead of buying the house that i bought then if i known i would i would have you know the situation i have now waited to get something different but you know how can you you know how that hides out you make the best decision that you can after time. with the best information available you know after you have looked at several options. being independent and educated able to take care of myself. thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. okay. albino. okay.,0,0,3,0.8720333,0.12796669,,,,,487
28,159,i'm not a therapist. are you okay with this yes. okay. how are you doing today. sign. where are you from originally. washington dc. whether the food. and the people. traffic. you travel a lot psi do. what do you enjoy. learning about different cultures. i just recently went to the united kingdom for a wedding 2 years ago or last year. probably. i don't know i have a lot. what you study at school. computer information systems. what do you do now now i coach children in basketball. what's your. i'm doing my dream job. i'll going. i have a very close relationship with my family. sometimes when i'm feeling 10 i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got. i go swimming. i'm very well very very good at controlling my temper. it was this morning and it was about business. situation with my ex girlfriend. what's something you feel guilty about. what i have to do when i was in the marine corps. tell me about the hardest to see. the hardest decision i ever had to make was when i was active duty in the marine corps just. deciding if i wanted to put my life in danger to save the lives of other people and i had about a second to decide. tell me about nevada or something that you wish you could erase my memory. my trip to combat in kosovo. she has. fine. about me feeling fine. i don't know what more to tell you i feel good. no. can you tell me about that. my thoughts have been consistent there are no changes. it's not that easy. this restless. have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd no. all right. have you been diagnosed. no. when was the last. about an hour ago. tell me more about that. i play basketball everyday and i was playing this morning before i came here and just. the peak of my happiness is what while i'm playing. my father. can you tell me about that he's just been a guiding force. determined. i made a filet mignon steak on the george foreman grill last night and i loved it. what are you most proud of. my ability to help people. thanks for sure. absolutely. goodbye goodbye. okay.,0,0,3,0.9206355,0.07936444,,,,,654
29,161,everything right this is you want to go alone. okay. yeah. okay well. what's up just want to see what they look like to i like to try to be aware of like how i'm answering which means about her it would be okay. okay. okay alright. oh i see okay i got you okay. what was she say okay okay i got you then alright thank you. hi. are you okay with this sure. doing okay. i'm from my la. yeah. i like the weather i like the sports teams like the entertainment. it's pretty much the same you're wrong as far as the weather could be good and could be bad you don't get to get all four seasons so it's kind of like a mixed bag and i guess that means i'm kind of used to it by now so be nice to explore other areas i will draw my life having too much traveling so it's a little bit of a kind of a readiness to it but overall it's okay. okay. i like the computer programming and operations but that's going back to the 70 so it's technology has changed a lot as you can tell the last 40 years that's right that's why i chose my major yeah. i know it's kind of this kind of inquisitive it to get to use your mind you was like your brand-new something you know very novel back in the in the old days you know i'm back in the seventies now it's turned into computers but back then i was sort of like something very unique you didn't see too many computers around back then and then programming so it's kind of been to the logical together solving a particular problem he'll come up with a step-by-step solutions on i guess i'll sort of the analytical ennis of the year the problem. i know i kind of facetime still use computers but i haven't gotten i've been have been in programming for a long time. well i kind of got into an another area kind of divorce intuit diversion to another area my life this is going back to the late 70s i kind of took another turn and then by the time i got back into it was i kind of got into another field so i never really pursued it to the degree that i wanted to. what's your dream job wow that's a good question i never thought about that ironically actually pretty simple this point in time this is kind of like a little bit depressed and then i am at this point it kind of just wanted to kind of just do a nice relaxing job but i do want it somewhat of a challenge but i don't want to have to like do too much too much thinking it's almost said what i was back in the in the old days you know i just want a nice comfortable relaxing job but i can feel fulfillment on but i don't want to chance of a situation kind of point in my life i just want a nice relaxing job. yeah. oh i would say well the most part shot because once i get going i could be outgoing but i'm shy to begin with and then i x i can listen up and be more outgoing and spend i can take it to the extreme arm talking too much like once upon gates open at the kind of open up too much so i have to like back off now but overall it's a i'm kind of shy as it is a general demeanor. okay. sometime. turn on the fish tank screensaver. yeah. well i listen to music by watch tv. just was what it would do to relax a stressful situation so i can have them stay relaxed elsa talk to my friends to i'll be around an area about kind of a comfort area where i feel safe i can just dialogue with people so kind of gets me out of my think about my own problems i'm having a kind of just you know focus on being in the moment with my friends and acquaintances. i'm pretty good i don't really have a temper problem it takes a lot to get me to to explode i think when i was in my younger days i think it was a bit more. had a little bit slight bit of tampa never had a really bad temper but tempers not really an issue i have to be pretty mellow easy-going. wow that's a good question i'm not sure to be honest. i don't think about that for a long time and to be honest i can't come with an answer on that not really part of my repertoire nothing comes to mind. my head. well. well don't say anything on the way back and made some bad and bad investments back about 10 years ago. how's more. charlie like what i'm looking for more trusting of people like that people in like them i thought were expert in their field and i inherited some money i was little bit careless with it and i just kind of had a vibe you know that nothing would go wrong kind of little bit of night-night tivity and unfortunately some bad financial decision is kind of put me in a bad position for the rest of my life and fortunately he got because of a medical conditions i have talking to rebounding you don't make it all up so i was saved mainly financial and investment decisions that i really regret. tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to me. wow. that's a tough one. i can't think everything about my head. okay. well i don't really have too much family left the only one i have is my it just me and my uncle and we could we communicate on a regular basis he look but he lives in clearwater florida so long we were okay but. he's like it isn't he's in his eighties and i was young my my 50 so we can we do we have kind of small talk and he's kind of concerned about my well-being but it's kind of somewhat of a on a shell of a really deep and that he's got his own problems so we don't really get into too deep of a conversation. other than him it's really there's not really anybody else to have i did that part makes me a little depressed cuz i don't really feel i have anybody i can really count on a really confide in. it is challenging i don't know why but i do have a medical condition something that might be part of the problem and i have a little bit of bph so i'll be out of town for the restroom and answer your question to make a long story short it is challenging to get a good night's wake up feeling a little bit tired aching but it is difficult. how deep is feeling lately. well i've been feeling okay i mean. be kind of feeling now actually trying to address issues that i haven't taken responsibility for. but i feel a bit of calmness as of late. have you ever been tagged. no. well i just say yes. the questionnaire and i'm not positive if it was technically diagnosed with it i did take a venus call the mmph the minnesota multi-faceted personality something of whether this is going back about six months ago they were asking me questions about my memory but then they also got two questions about my my well being psychologically too and i think some of the answers to the advice that i see a psychologist or psychiatrist i didn't follow that up on that because the philosophical differences but i think i might have a mild case of depression. well you don't like i said i'm just kind of like kind of goat along in life and i'm doing okay but you know highlights passed me by so i haven't really fulfilled my my goal was kind of like alone i'd like to have a girlfriend i don't have a girlfriend so that's kind of tell me who i feel i can get close to and i'm not really in my life right now so what is a certainty i'm having some kind of financial uncertainties so overall not doing as good as i'd like to. okay. tell me about the last time you felt really happy. that's a good one really happy. let me think about that a minute. well actually it wasn't that long ago actually i want you. okay i know that one actually i think i'm going to answer i hope that old lady she was at a trade show it was a anaheim with natural products expo so it's pretty nice we we had some nice meals afterwards there's a lot of exhibitors giving out really nice samples it was an anaheim some kind of got a chance to get away from la and. met some interesting people are they were very outgoing they're willing to like having experienced their product or service and i was around people that i work with who i got to socialize with old was pretty happy back then and it was about a month ago. yeah that was. best friend and i really have a best friend but. i would say. i don't know technically i really don't have a best friend so she heard me answer that so i can't really come with an answer to be honest. i like to be conscientious and i do have flaws mary but i think the overall unconscientious i try to be honest for the most part i'm on the major issues i might you know they would have likewise or you know i'm not perfect i'm not going to come to the serious stuff i tend to be pretty honest i'm a hard worker. good work ethic. can you be pretty calm for the most part. play regret. what can you elaborate on that. well. i just well just overall i regret them. not be a little more assertive in my earlier. earlier life if i put myself in this position is going to go back to my financial decisions that was sort of that sort of like my albatross in my life i made some bad decisions and unfortunately the kind of pay the price for now so i kind of like sort of like living sort of a popper existence right now which is kind of kind of depressing so i would say that's part of what i regret most of all. advice would you give yourself 10. well i would say to really you don't analyze kind of go with what you really feel. i think i was going with other people's opinion other people's advice i was kind of going away from my basic beingness you don't like the way i really felt like i'd make you aggressive investing which if it turned out good it would be like for like when the lot i would have been well off for the rest of my life but unfortunately it went the opposite way too many eggs in a basket so i kind of regret it going with my gut feeling and let other people influence me and i could by nature i'm a conservative person so i should really do more conservative investments another is my life at 10 to be more conservative but i kind of made some aggressive financial decision so that's pretty much. can a local doctor that area as far as what i regret. wow. that's interesting i've been doing a lot of working weekends so well i do like to be profitable to do something where i can actually you don't make money that's sort of like my bread and butter time could you trade shows but i'm not doing that then i'm like maybe watch some men you know i like to go to entertainment maybe go to a ball game go to a movie go with some friends so just going to kick back but my main primary primary focus will be on earning earning money on the weekends. huh. that's interesting. what's prerogative. i would say that i live by and large all of the wholesome life i would say i never got myself into any kind of really bad. bad advice you know i. i love the pretty hoe salsa my wife i said i'll probably i don't really proud but as far as i stay the course as far as not going down any real deep to speak. okay. my pleasure. that's pretty interesting is it improve your technology on a lot more like you're talking to a live person siri. it was kind of a little bit more academy can tell us like a more like a like a video game this looks more like a real person communicates like. return for not trying to deal with her but it was some other guys and i think i know what it was but it was a little bit more. i can't reveal all the details but this is see no more comfortable more natural. yeah.,1,1,3,0.2811017,0.71889824,,,,,409

we're really close. i mean my family small we live within blocks of each other but yeah we're close. good or bad. most memorable. just given birth to the first time it was just amazing my son is 9 now so i still remember it like it was yesterday. like i was. being born again myself i don't know how to explain it and just very. emotional. i don't know i guess i have a lot of regrets but. and that i really want to mention i guess. stay in school. don't get emotionally involved. and let people deter you from your goals. oh yeah. definitely. did you want me to. i'm okay i mean i'm pretty easy-going. for the most part i don't really have a temper per say things frustrate me more than they anger me. oh that's easy with my mother she's like i guess the argument stem from me wanting to. socialize she feels bad i married with children if i should stay at home by 99% of the time and i wanted to go out and socialize with the ex co-workers and she basically. got to put me down for it as if i don't spend enough time with my children. it does and i love my mom i hate even having the thoughts of being frustrated with her because i was sick gosh i don't get mad at her then something happens to her the next day but she gets caught in truth. oh i know after this semester and then when i noted that you know i did well in school cuz i have been it has been a long time since i went to school so when i received my grade you know a and a b i like wow okay i can do this and it made me happy and i was about a few weeks ago i guess. thank you. my mom i know it's good and bad. i mean for the most part my mom has been a positive influence you know it's just sometimes you know she gets a little. like she wants to re-raise me or something like she doesn't understand that i'm an adult i'm going to make my own decisions now and pretty much have to let me do what i need to do. a lot of heavy breathing. are we at war oxidized like a little frustrated whatever i'll just go take a walk. you know or i'll just try not to think about it. thank you. yes. yes and maybe. i was 19. yeah yeah yeah. i didn't have any other options. i am i probably should have stayed in a little longer i was only in for 4 years but you know i wanted to experience life outside the military so i did my enlistment and then i got out. it may be a little bit more responsible than some of my friends that you know did not join the military i get notice a big difference as far as you know how i live my life and how they live there's just maybe a little bit more responsible. thank you. i worked in the medical field for about 5 years and oh thank you.. but i'm it wasn't for me i wanted to do something a little bit different i didn't want to do patient care i wanted to work with people but not necessarily as a patient care provider so i started going to school and that i met my husband i stopped going to school got married and i started working at telecommunications field and then we you know conceived a child and after that. you know. i think i'm kari wino i am i'm very caring you know very honest to a fault sometimes you know i try to be as honest as possible with people sometimes it can hurt their feelings but you know you got to be honest you get that people think that you know you're not trusting and it. yeah probably i don't i never really thought about it. i don't know maybe i don't really think about i just try to be the best person i can be you know so. so i can do i can't live for what other people think i can only do what i need to do. i don't know. i hadn't really thought about it. i guess it's just me and i'll be around my kids you know i just love being around my children. that's always puts me in a good mood. thank you. okay i got that look tired you know but you know for the most part okay you know deal with situations different. why go to bed really early so long as i go to bed early i got a good night's sleep but i wake up early as well so. has got a right. good and bad a little bit i'll go to bed at 8:30 and then i wake up at like 1:00 1:30. very moody. very irritable short short-tempered i guess. if anything i think i'm thinking more positively you know like i said especially with my son having a disability you know i look at it as if you know it's not all bad. i mean he has challenges it but i'm dealing with them a lot better. you are supposed to feeling sorry for him or feeling sorry for myself you know i'm just fighting more avenues to work with him you know different resources to help him as opposed to just feeling guilty we are sad and depressed about it. thank you. no. occasionally. who does it. i don't know do we skip that question. green seems to be the word kind of like. yeah probably green light. naive a little. but at the same time smart i think she'll just grab me a smart. thank you. okay. no problem. bye. are applied i kind of skipped one question.,0,0,3,0.91540766,0.08459239,,,,,341
32,176,i may have you. all right. okay sure. yes. i'm not bad i'm a little tired but okay. i from st. louis missouri. yep. 2 months ago. not often i think i'm out here for good now. smaller town less people everyone kind of acts different the pace of life is slower out there. looking for work as a game designer and developer just try something new to new place new people. i guess i'm still getting used to it. i guess people are different you know there's little shops everywhere just everything's different. the weather is great out here. people are really nice. like to look at the mountains the beaches nice just better geography. traffic i guess the commute and sometimes there's maybe too many people. not really never been outside of the us before. i just never had the opportunity i'd love to go though. a game design and graphic design sort of. i love it. play video games since i was a kid like most guys my age so just like making people happy and it's kind of easy to do that with games. i work for myself make my own games write my own paychecks i guess. a pretty hard i've been trying to do it for the past couple years it's a little difficult. i guess i'm kind of shy it depends on the people in the environment i guess. play guitar listen to some music talk to friends. play i'm pretty good at controlling my temper i'm not the type of guy that gets angry really easily. probably with my girlfriend over something silly i can't even remember. don't know i don't think i'm really guilty about anyting try to avoid being guilty. don't know. can't really think of anything. leaving st louis was one of them is all my friends and family were there. i guess the benefits outweighed you know the cons. are you happy. definitely. maybe getting kicked out of high school first time. i just i ended up getting myself and then my friends in trouble and it was just no good you kind of look back on it and. i guess that's something for my pastor wish i would have done different. follow the rules i guess just been a good student would have helped. not really that close with my family i've got a small family anyway and when i was in st louis we'd see each other a couple times a year but that's really it so no strong ties. i guess most of my friends are always there to support me and encouraged me and helped me so. it's a pretty easy every once in a while there's a night i can't sleep but it's pretty rare. just tired groggy guess my mind's unfocused and day goes by a heck of a lot longer. i'm pretty good. not really much to say. maybe a little bit more depressed cuz i'm away from most of my friends and family but nothing unmanageable. try to talk to him when i can think about something else think about a happy times. no. no. i guess on the drive out here so it was such a new experience and so exhilarating. i think graduating college those really proud of myself and really looking forward to the future. just i guess kind of euphoria standing there it seems kind of surreal. funny caring nice guy. easily along with. pretty happy being me i guess. guess what i broke up with my last girlfriend for obvious reasons we tend to fight and say things you wish you'd forget i guess. now i don't like to live in the past so there's nothing to really regret. keep working hard and just keep thinking about what you do before you do it. on the computer playing video games with friends. music. and my friends i guess. i guess my determination of might have my passion. my creativity. all right.,0,0,3,0.9160208,0.08397917,,,,,485

some good days and bad days i guess i've gotten used to it so i'm going to be i don't know if that makes sense but. accessibility to two different things some as compared to nebraska. him more opportunities to do different things and then for different things. areas of interest. crime. attitude. lack of lack of. i work ethic lack of. kindness and people cut throat. i used to i bet. sense of freedom. the adventure. okay. you want me to tell you about a trip. egypt. i went with my mother and some family friends we went on an 8 day cruise down the nile. so how the pyramids in giza just it was just a big credible adventure just to get away from everything and everybody and and close friends and just have a great time. not really at all. just a history of. abuse and neglect and just had a real functional family dysfunctional all this is definitely keyword in our family so. thank you. no not really i'm talked about a lot before so. i'm okay with it. so hard to say i haven't had very good done. rapunzel role model some. ask me the question again. well maybe a best my mother but she's also been a negative aspect of my life what time. yeah i guess i can't really identify anybody who's been a real real positive influence in my life. the trips that i've been on. i used to work out i used to do yoga i used to. needs to meditate i used to exercise sign i used to. i used to do hot things lately i find it hard to relax and i don't have the same. the same outlets that i did before the same. i said i don't pursue them as much anymore i guess i'm. a lot of motivation or something and depressed about it and i guess there it is right there. pretty good night by distemper as far as getting to the point of physicality at don't ever that. but i stand my ground and. but i can control my temper i ain't never lose control really. the last time. probably. as recently as you know. in the last month or so i may be argued with some. an acquaintance over. i don't know i have to come back to that question. no. no. yes. will officially october of last year but i've i think i've been depressed longer than that but officially october of last year. actually i was being treated for other medical issues and depression was notable to the doctors so. yeah. i've never been suicidal but just to just to just stopping at thought. they don't have much reason to live i used to think i had a purpose and such but i don't really have anybody in my life. who i think cares enough about me. did arie flowers even dad so i've kind of lost myself. and i used to tell you speak enough. that i was enough to. he noted to have purpose in my life but i've lost quite a bit of that. do you think that maybe you're being a little. well i'm trying to pull it together i'm trying to. get back since me against fired every once in awhile but overall i just don't seem to be making much progress. yeah. i wouldn't really call it therapy i don't have a therapist per say i have a nurse practitioner who prescribes medication for me. and nobody really to talk about psychosocial issues. did you say that sucks. okay. yeah. overwhelms bracket pied. just trying to stay alive stay on top of things. now. how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep. easy when i can i don't ya when i get a chance to fall asleep i don't have any problem with it. i'm even more distracted and. even more. lackluster i guess is the word. whatever. if i had a best friend. i don't know. maybe it's not a positive that it's just before but now just you know just. some people say i should be proud cuz i'm surviving a hard time or some people think that. i'm not a loser. so i don't know maybe. a survivor persistent. i need flies be proud of my career and kind of giving back to people giving back to society because i was given. a lot of felt like. so i'm just proud to. i don't have much of a sense of right anymore be quite honest by i've. in psychology. and i'm well initially yeah. no not ready for sale though my current career involves a lot of. psychology a lot of. yes pics i don't know i'm trans am. it's a bit sad part of it but it's not the center of it. well i guess if my career is still going i'm in

i suppose working with people again. health guy helping in some way. no but lately was depression and more so at times. i used to say that i never regretted anything cuz i make the best decision of all things in front of me but. i just wish there were times then that. the choices that i would have. we're better cuz some choices that i seem to have made or were made for me have made my world kind of shity. for lack of a better word shity. would understand. should be strong to believe in myself. to remember that i've survived a lot of things and i will survive this too. get up off my ass and move. two dumb. have confidence. faith. murphy's law has kicked my ass. so much you know i just. it seems like when i have tried to make my world better i just keep getting knocked down. so it's

food of actually i enjoyed flying then you know meeting different people different scenes. you know then it right try to achieve my goals. i'm sorry. i used to run a business i used to travel to meet people to get orders and that traveling involved and going to northeast vienna ohio and pennsylvania places like that meet top people to get my to get orders for my business and you know why i enjoyed listening to that problem so used to take them out for dinner and you know i really enjoyed genuinely enjoyed talking to talking to them and many of them we're opening up to tell me about their problems and you know but my main goal main main objective was to get the orders for the business. you don't cook watch movies make friends throw a party. i'm talking to you. i'm an engineer i did mechanical engineering i'm also in nba. actually i bradshaw to finance i trade stocks now. a friend of mine was you know making a lot of money in stocks and you know i was. first i used to you know we interact with him will also be with him when he was trading stocks and i realized he was making a lot of money than i did a form of course in that attended a lot of seminars then you know. lost a lot of money and before i started making money. so it's the same thing that i said you don't watch movies go visit people. play basketball. then do shopping cooking. i'm very good at that you know. even when i'm irritated and i'm very good at controlling my temper. the last time i argue with. was with my brother it was about my dad peanut but you was getting old i mean he's getting old and he lives in india and i was planning on bringing it here my dad's i mean my brother said it's going to be very expensive to. you know it's going to be very expensive with respect to health bills and i was arguing with him that we should all pull in the money and get them here because they are quite old i have a mom to you know they're both old. i'm very close to my parents not so closed with my brother and their family. it's deep i mean like. i tend to be judgmental and i think sometimes that the my niece and nephew should have been brought up in a different way and you know. and you know my my brother doesn't seem to think along the same lines and you know but we have disagreements and you know that's the reason. it is. no not at this time. what do i think of wife. can you can you repeat that one more time. can i still couldn't follow you. okay. no. no. oh yes. wanted 2 years ago. i was feeling down and i was not interested in things that are that i would normally interested in. and you know i was sort of withdrawn and the it was i was not able to focus on my things so i thought maybe i should go see a doctor and i ended up doing that. no. how many died last appetite i was not sleeping well and. i had difficulty concentrating you know and focusing and i would not getting my assignments done on time these were some of the problems. i've been feeling good. but. no i don't. i started doing yoga and you know i've been doing that for about a year and that's and meditation and that's helped a lot. so it's just that you know when i was diagnosed with depression i thought i should be taking any medication for it and i was looking at it other ways to get over the problem and then i realized some of my friends we're doing meditation and. oh you know i ain't got into in spider-man. it's a little difficult but after i've been able to sleep with in half an hour there are days when it takes almost 1/2 hours to go to sleep. are they what can you repeat that. oh no. i just been open. just switch off the light and binoo keep tossing around then. try to focus on things that makes me feel good. and the snap. but three days ago. what am i proud of. i wasn't out i was among the top 2% in my mba class and. and when i used to run my business i designed a product that was working really well. and i was happy that i was able to design something that was so useful for my business. my. i'm thinking my friends would describe me as very friendly very easy to get along with. very focused very intelligent. and a good cook. albert einstein. of. summer summer summer full stories. you know he obviously didn't it involves lot of deep thinking and are the the first few times i write about him about his theories i had difficulty in really understanding that and that it over. i mean when when when there are things that i really try to understand and i am not able to. and you know they're out there all the type of people i admire. listen to other people. are its diverse and i like the the entertainment industry. and. i like a. the other fact that there are more women than men here. there are certain areas where wendy's where only spanish is spoken you know i would like for all people who come to america to be able to understand english and be able to speak in english. so that everybody can participate. in la. me like i. some of the things the political leaders do really makes me mad sometimes i think they're wasting their wasting their time our time and other countries are advancing and you know what these guys don't get things done and you know i feel very bad about it and sometimes it makes me angry. yeah i mean the first four years of obama administration now i think it was wasted because if the. if congress had acted together and got things done then you know. maybe we could have made it much more difficult for china to catch up with us and you know the fact that china is able to do things and get things done much faster and these people steal you know arguing. you know follow-up find fault with each other and not get things done. they don't seem to realize that you don't you know that clock keeps ticking you know they have to get things done. i mean like you know well. one thing that comes to my mind is well you know i made a lot of money while we know once in los angeles and you know i thought it happened during christmas some 10 years ago. and that's that made me very happy. good music good food. i mean the party with friends that i like. hand. and. you know i also like cooking and i enjoy cooking with groups in groups do the things that really put me in a good mood. i'm sorry clean. i listen to people. and i empathize try to solve their problems. and i'm hoping they think i'm it up my advisers and recommendations are worth their time. thank you so much to be nice by.,0,0,3,0.81916934,0.18083066,,,,,322
36,193,like. is this okay. okay. okay thank you. i'm going to bring her up bring a l a pretty name does it stand for. oh okay. oh that's right. of equations when she recognizes what you say okay coolness. oh i got it. okay. valley let's go. i don't want no problems. no problem does tracking my facial stuff right now. okay. that is so need okay. party. okay. okay. okay. okay. sound like a plan. okay. okay thank you. thank you. okay. yes. i'm doing fine thank you. california. san pedro california. find the weather of course i really love the weather also this is where all my family lives so. you know it's good to be around your family. and just a lot to do out here. i wouldn't say a lot like maybe once or twice per year. memorable in a good way i would say having my children at three children so i guess that's the most memorable. right now i'm just doing liberal arts so general studies nothing specific. i do take a lot of i do take a lot of science classes because eventually i do want to pursue education in psychology but that's later on. my dream job i really thought about it. i don't know. honestly i really don't know. i wouldn't say shy i'm a little reserved i think there's a little difference. oh no not really shy. to text me a little bit longer to warm up. i don't know i just like to read people before i really open up to them to see how much i'm willing to share. and how much i'm not willing to share. it's okay i mean i love my family we have our ups and downs. specifically i guess with my mother you know is a little bit more up but i'm the only girl so it's expected i have three brothers so with that being said it is what it is it's good when it's good and when it's not good. it could be better. probably watch tv or you know does not got my pick up a book or something magazine see what's going on in fashion just something to keep my mind off things. pretty good i also play games i like to play games on my phone on the computer things like that i wouldn't say i have a temper you know just average you know when things upset me i deal with them but i don't overdo it i don't you know explode or anything like that. probably what's today friday probably my see was it yesterday no day before yesterday actually was with my mom it's it's so funny the argument with about she feels that because i'm a mother a wife and a mother that i should not have a social life. meaning i should be at home knitting or something i don't know so it was small that wasn't a big argument just you know i mentioned that i may go to a comedy event and she was against it i said well it's really not your decision i'm an adult so that was about it. that's about it. recently. probably. i mean thick i'll probably should have you know. oh i know when my husband and i were discussing relocating from california i basically put my foot down and said i wasn't you know willing to do that and i probably should have kept it up in mind because there are some pros to moving or relocating but i guess at the time i really just didn't want to hear it so i just put my foot down and said you know we're not going anywhere with staying here i probably should have been more understanding because he is from. you know he's not from california so he's probably feeling a little homesick and i should have took that into consideration. guilty probably not spending as much time with my kids it's not because i don't want to spend time with them many not altogether like usually when i spend time with my children it's separate when i always together unfortunately because my middle son has autism so he takes a little bit more time so i wish that you know we could all be together and i do feel guilty about that. but it's difficult. so i try to give them their own individual time. but it. hardest decision probably i don't know. my former occupation my former job relocated for about an hour and a half away something like that little bit over an hour depending upon traffic and was a good paying job great benefits great people but i had to basically. play myself off from that job which did create a financial hardship in my family but i didn't have a choice because of our you know situation with our son and having only one vehicle for transportation if it's a lot of other factors you know i basically had to stop working and that was a big decision but you know i always say happiness over finances you know you can all i can always you know find another job but you know having my family together and being happy that's a different story. that's about it. oh that's easy probably when i had my face injured when i was in the military yeah i wish i could erase that i mean something that i see everyday when i look in the mirror i don't dwell on it it's just there but it is a mark on my face that i didn't deserve. he knows a traumatic experience but it's been about. i'm a 15 years or so it's been quite a while but if i could erase it yeah that would be yet. yes i was in the navy. for 4 years. 19. didn't have any other options it really wasn't. planning on joining the military but i didn't want to go back to school at the time i just figured you're going to the military with give me the background that i needed and money for school so that's about that shows. yeah. i mean can change it i mean i'm not unhappy i'm at a lot of nice people you know so that was good but there was some issues that i had the military that i had not went you know probably would you know when a lot differently but you know you can't change the past. no glad i did it i'm not really for that uptight person. yeah it's unfortunate you know but now i did it. the transition where was it was a little difficult at first you know having to adjust having a fine at the all career and you just. not having that. how do you say. i guess i felt like comfort in the military because i knew that i was always going to have that pay check it out when i was supposed to do i always have a roof over my head you know things like that you know the civilian life basically. it's your meds you don't know like you lose your job monday or you know whatever so that's alright transition i got used to it pretty quickly. thank you. i went to school i started working with a communications company. i did some medical care as well. got married and have children. maybe a little bit more responsible i know that for a fact you know if people my age at the time you know didn't have a lot of responsibility most of my still living at home you know at early age i was out on my own

anything else i don't really argue with people. i don't argue i don't like confrontation. my parents of course very very much so. i had great parents. reminder of my parents were at tuskegee which is a black college they always want me to go to a black college with course i didn't want to do that annoy. they're very positive role model for me the certain things that i don't do today because of them i don't drink i don't curse i don't look down people do but i don't have as much respect for people who do a lot of either one of those things i love to drive i love to travel and my dad's always take us someplace every weekend he was up we go somewhere to chicago indiana michigan how much the area we go up the machine pick fruit or we got all our dogs from puppy farms in indiana that kind of thing i had uncle lived in wisconsin who was up very far, so my daddy said love to drive and i love to travel. that's a hard one. i've had a lot of great experiences i think the best one was that we went awry anniversary we went to europe we went to paris and we wrote the orient express we went from luengo always stand by we went from london to venice and then flew back to paris that was probably the best friend i ever had in my life i never really cared for europe because it's so much here united states to do in social america and i've been to alaska and hawaii but we said it was something different and we always watch it on the orient express and we did that expensive but phenomenal drip god wants the one strip mat once-in-a-lifetime just once. not traveling more sooner we did a lot when the kids were younger but. but i think we should have probably done we didn't do i wish i'd gone because we always have chicago on thanksgiving but i think we should have gotten more than just on thanksgiving my parents come here at christmas time by the equation of a line. a lot more when it comes to that. yes that's that's that's why i threw regret because it could have been avoided the things we could have done and we spend their time working and more concerned about getting ahead then actually family what's closest to us. oh yes they definitely. that's a good question today 20

yes. so how are you doing today. okay. atlanta georgia. in 2006. never. i don't like it there. it's completely boring and there's very little to do la is preferable i think to most places. because i was engaged to my fiance and we lived in florida i moved there to be with him and he loves the water but i love the mountains i missed hiking and i love florida and he wasn't tied to it so we decided we wanted to go somewhere where we can both be happy and also have more opportunities in business and. all of the great things that i have to offer. very. easy. there's not much i don't like about la i love la i think it feels magical so many creative different people of all ages shapes sizes colors races the mountains of water. the city all the things that there are to do all of the different people there are to meet i just i love everything about la. no. i'd rather not talk about it. i didn't go to college. i'm still figuring that out. i don't know it may may have something to do with animals i have a dog that i really loved and i never had a dog as an adult i had cats and. i think i'm a late bloomer so i'm working on that whole conversation i don't i really don't want a job i want a purposeful way to create wealth not just something to make money in the long run. it depends on the situation but in general i consider myself more scheib although most people would consider me to be outgoing. sometimes when i'm feeling. i turn on the fish tank screensaver. what do you do. put on classical music music classical music especially stressed and play with my dog. go for a walk. i think i'm really good at controlling my temper. for the most part. before i came here it was just about them. financial stress. there's probably a lot of examples i think i'd rather move to another question. yeah i'd rather not talk about that either. i'd rather not talk about that. how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep. not very easy at all. i'm a lot better recently but i have a history of chronic insomnia and some health problems so it's challenging not to feel rested most of the time. in the past week i've been feeling a lot better. tell me about that. yes i. the weather has changed spring has sprung it's a little warmer as having more trouble with my depression in the winter and having trouble with tolerating cold and so i wasn't doing a lot of the things that i normally do and i also was sick with the flu and in the past week i decided that i was feeling better enough that i needed to kind of get out of my rut and start getting more focused around things that i need to do during the day and walking my dog everyday and not isolating so much. sing some of my friends more so i was feeling i've been feeling a lot better like i've been making progress and that. in the past week things have taken a more positive turn. no. yes. it's been quite some time of officially it's probably been. i don't know exactly but let's see. maybe more than 15 years ago. i was feeling suicidal. no. because i found a better alternative. i've been there be off and on since i was 18 and i'm tried a variety of methods and then i started working with some neuro-linguistic programming her and that was really the first person that helped me. make permanent changes and i was able to get off my antidepressants as well and even though i struggle with some bouts of depression it's never been anything extremely severe and i was one of the best things that ever happened. well i was physically ill with chronic fatigue syndrome and i had a client that referred me to this person because he had cured her of that disease and. that was he treats multiple issues and so everything is interrelated so. once i had my first conversation with him i knew it was the right step for me. i'm so happy. i felt like i was some. i felt that. i found the answer that i've been looking for that i hadn't given up hope. panda. i would like i'm glad 9 that i had been suffering for a long time and i felt that i finally. found. the answer to the. solution that i was looking for i was like. every last thing i ever did in my life or the best decision i ever made. extremely helpful for the first time in a long time. i went to. i went to a music store. because i've been thinking about i'm taking up an instrument i used to play the violin as a child and i've been wanting to do something that would give me more access to my creative side because i felt it's been extremely depressed and numb. that's how i went to the music store to try out to see what it would feel like to. to handle and the instrument again and see if i thought that that was something that i would want to pursue. it was awesome. yeah i'd rather not talk about that. well. that's probably a lot but. i'm always working on being more optimistic. it's been challenging it takes time but. i wish i could hear my own. internal voice better. yeah i have regrets sure. value myself more so that i would make better. relationship decisions. my fiance is the most positive. person in my life my my ultimate supporter. tell me about. i think very unique not the. not at all selfish and the. probably a little too giving for his butt. always has my best interest at heart has the highest morals of anyone i know would give somebody the shirt off of his back is a genius and so many ways and. i'm pretty lucky i think. that. i'm not a quitter that despite some very stressful circumstances over long periods of time i haven't given up on. taking risks and.,1,1,3,0.32774594,0.6722541,,,,,402
41,209,i was that man. when do i talk okay okay. okay. yeah that okay okay it's better okay thanks. okay thank you thank you. yes. okay. los angeles. the weather. the variety of environments the ocean you know various different environment or environmental variety. i don't like the superficiality of people the narcissistic attitude. just the. it doesn't have a small-town sort of feel where you know just the warm the human sort of warms the interactively so yeah. no. am i have a fear of flying and i have developed agoraphobia. incredibly difficult. i'm guessing you mean the agoraphobia more so than the fear of flying it's it's more of a recent development and. it's it's pregret it's progressing to be worse it's very what's the word immobilizing and very distressing actually. yes it is. how do i cope with that. just. just trying to do the best i can and try to you know have the most courage i can in the situation and challenge myself and small steps i read a lot i do i'm bibliotherapy reading and i try to inform myself of the of the professional literature i'm so that i could hopefully over comment someday. yes definitely. certain things trigger at like enclosed spaces being in a car traveling being away from home being in someone else's car things that are outside of my locus of control. add actually i don't go to school right now. my dream job is. to be a psychologist. i'm not a psychologist but what would make me decide to do that is. having lived through some challenges like this having lived through some traumas but i've always had an interest in it since junior high of i'm very interested in people and men human interaction and human connection and the betterment of of of those things bridging people together and helping people interpersonally through their child personal challenges so that's that's sort of in a nutshell. i think i'm someone who's. i can be very outgoing and sort of a warm and friendly presents very easily but i think on the exterior but i think i'm shy and i challenged it to do that. i think it hard i'm shy but i but i challenge myself completely cuz i do love human interaction so i take those risks and and jump and those challenges. the last time i interacted with somebody was today. if i think i'm understanding your question correctly. oh no i think i misunderstand your question but i i interacted with rachel i just i'm continuously interacting with people. take taking those risks. a very good. very good. i just left them argued with somebody. actually can't remember it wasn't recent. i have to think about that i don't know yet let me think. i'm drawing a blank i can only remember things. from what i was like 21 right now i can't think of anything contemporary right right now my mind is. okay i when i was younger. can you tell me about that yes i lost a relationship with my aunt and my uncle and my cousin's cuz when i was 21 on 45 i. i had a disagreement with my aunt and i said something that was a critical of her and she threw me out of their home and. let me back i apologized immediately and they let me back into their lives and change their minds so. i regret that. i'm assuming you mean how do i feel when they asked me to never i'll be in their lives again and to leave shattered soul shattered heart shattered. tell me about. well that that was my family that was the good side of my family there's. the majority of my fat they were they were the the loving aspect of my family on the rest of my family is very cruel and very abusive. i'm i don't have any relationship with my family at all like there since i was 21 since my aunt and uncle. disown me i guess it's the right word estranged yeah. gosh i'm drawing a blank just bear with me for one second something i could erase. i can't even get it to my memory. as an example. i was injured and i wish i could get that away from my memory. yeah i was injured in the emergency room. doing i went in for food poisoning i was ordered to go in by a doctor i had collapsed and i was ordered to go into the er for that i said food poisoning and i came out injured with a neurological syndrome i was injured with a. what do you call it. intravenous procedure and now i have rsd reflex sympathetic dystrophy and the scene in the emergency room was it was an out-of-control saying there was a problem with the procedure and the doctor was yelling at his staff who made a mistake and it was extremely excruciating it was a crisis and so every time i think about the injury and it was disfigured i got disabled got disabled for disabled permanently from it was also a disabled from my employment for a quite amount of a given amount of time as well and and it i have residual physical trauma from it and disfigurement and. severe disability disability limited functionality with my right my i'm right-handed my right hand and arm thank you. tell me about the hardest decisions. i don't even know what that is. you know i i really i apologize cuz i can't really probably give you the most suitable answer. i'm guessing it has something to do with my cat and her her urgent. what do you call it. i heard she was in intensive care veterinary care and i'm sure it had something to do with that. but other than that i would say i had choosing my life path weather. and i was admitted to that program or whether i was going to go to art school for four years and i had to pick a life direction but that's not a traumatic situation. so i don't know how best to answer your question. i can't. i have severe nightmares and i have nocturnal panic attacks. are you triggered by something and i also have physical illness on top of it and i'm in excruciating pain. you have disturbing thoughts. yes. yes. yes they're triggered by the injury that i told you they're triggered by my family. how they've treated me what they said to me what they've done to me they're triggered by what else my my physical illness not my injury olney but my physical illness as well so yes. i feel very ill. and feel so fatigued. very ill and very fatigued. when i don't sleep and get enough sleep at my anxiety level i believe is up and i'm susceptible to feeling distressed so yeah. yes. 3 years ago my most recent diagnosis and in 2001 as well. oh yes. 3 years ago and. when i was. 20 years old. the my background my childhood from my family of origin and there are the abuse that i went through and their ultimate what's the word. rejection of me and estrangement that was the first reason. no i stopped 6 months ago. why did i stop i'm just taking a break i'm going to continue. yes very much. it's helped tremendously. i think it helps with anxiety at helps with. it helps inspire crate inspiration that helps feeling connected it helps to create what i ultimately my goal is to give myself a voice and it helps to to side is part of that process it also helps to understand myself to learn about myself. and there's just so many benefits it's. i'll stop right there and there's many more. the last time i felt really happy is it was a really long time ago it was before my illness and it was in 1997 on the outside of my illness was in july of 97 so it was before that. yes i was in a very good place in terms of my career in terms of my just my relationships and everything was just sort of at its best career relationships personal fulfillment start of as well i was very active and and doing a very many things that were made in full to build a life thumb and i was in the process of. just in the in the planning stages of my life but also very accomplished at the same time so it's just that they were just going very well and i was just really liked just where my life was at it was just in a really good place and many ways. i wish i could change about myself my anxiety i wish i could change about myself my agoraphobia my ptsd meeting my trauma and what else. my insecurities as far as just. with other people in the sense that i'm always trying to make sure that that i don't do something that that hold on one second i'm just trying to make sure that i don't do anything that's offensive to them or insults them or is disrespectful and i i feel like i'm overly cautious about that and it kind of becomes an anxiety unto itself so i i definitely think that would be beneficial to change the other thing i'd like to change about myself and i wish i could feel and also depression i'd like to change about myself i wish i could feel better i wish i didn't feel so tired of the burden that i do love my family i'm not having one. and what else i wish i didn't have my illness and the physical excruciating pain that i'm in so those are some things and i also wish that and this is a byproduct of ptsd i wish that i didn't have the the symptom ology of pti say is that definitely affects one's complete complete life like her life completely and i wish i was more articulate and i wish i was someone who was well-spoken and someone was well-written but there's many there's many more things that i wish i could change about myself to improve myself so many more. i'm not sure. maybe to not be so trusting i trusted. i trusted some medical professionals that. you know again created the injury and it a word. there's a what's the word there's an expectation and it sort of a demand to just blindly trust the medical profession and don't ask questions or just sort of you know and if not to trust your own self your own your own instincts or intuition and so i would i would have told myself to be a little more careful i guess if that's useful to your question. what did i really enjoy. and i can't think of anything specific. but. i know it would have to do. with either reading or connecting with someone on a meaningful level. i'm most proud of. my compassion. my my empathy and caring about people despite i mean i'm proud of it anyways but i'm also particularly am i come from an environment that's the opposite on the background and then the wasn't taught that but i really do care about people and. i'm i guess i'm most proud of that i'm also proud of my career accomplishments and my tenacity my my fierce tenacity to succeed and. you know just also to get the strength it takes to get through the injury to live with it and to live with the illness that i live at the physical illness so i think that would be it. yes. okay. you're welcome. bye. okay i've been crying and opening up to this person so i think i did but what you're what you wanted right i'm embarrassed cuz i got really sort of

43,214,okay. yes. i'm doing well. i was born in oakland. all the different areas of the city the different cultures that are here. the traffic the. lack of public transportation and the superficiality. i i don't i would love to travel more. being able to experience a different way of living getting outside the bubble that you normally live in and getting a different perspectives. i'm in 2008 i studied abroad in brazil and that was about four months and i was in bahia which is in the north and. see the program consisted of learning the history learning the language and staying with a homestay family. i've always wanted to travel and i chose to brazil because they have an afro brazilian population or large after brazilian population which i really want to learn more about and i think their history and their culture is really interesting. i think taking a bus by myself to a remote beach and just navigating on my own and figuring out where to go. right now i'm getting my masters in social work. dream job i think to consult about mental health and. how to. how to intervene effectively with different cultures and doing a research and consulting work and getting to travel. basically that those would be the main characteristics. i think that's a false dichotomy but i do consider myself shy but at the same time out going in the sense that i push myself to do things outside of my comfort zone and i'm determined to do what it takes to become successful. i listen to music and just lay on my bed and i guess you could say do mindfulness and really just take my mind off of things also breathing exercises which i'm learning more about as well as exercise. pretty good i don't get angry a lot so as far as angry temperament i'm pretty good at that. what month is this may probably two months ago. and i argued via text message so it's not really intense arguing but i guess you called arguing in a sentence over whether or not i should be forgiven for something that i thought was minor with a friend i've had for a few years. i felt anxious sad and angry. yeah those are the main emotions. i know them because i think i'm pretty in touch with my emotions and being able to identify them and then i'll notice the physical manifestations of emotions like if if my heart's racing or from getting sweaty. if i'm if my breathing is more shallow i'll know i'm anxious so i'll know something is bothering me. that i wish i had handled differently. i guess related to this argument i went out one night and got a little too intoxicated and ended up calling a person for a ride home but that really upset that person and i know that it wasn't such a big deal but i wish i hadn't have let myself get to that point. it impacted a relationship and i also felt really bad about what i did. hardest decision. wow probably deciding what type of graduate program to go into i briefly went to law school and decided not to do that so afterwards after dropping out i had to really rethink what it is that i wanted to do and what i wanted to dedicate my life to go into debt for spend a lot of energy on. i think by recognizing what i don't want to do and doing a lot of research on program requirements and the jobs that you can get after completing a program. after think. revolving around the same person i've spoke of earlier. it was a dating relationship and a few years ago we had a falling-out over his treatment of me and involved another person and i wish i could get that out of my mind. i have a pretty good relationship with my mom she lives in the bay area i didn't grow up with her but i've gotten closer to her as an adult. we talked pretty regularly with my dad i grew up with him mostly he lives in atlanta and we don't talk as much but we are we were pretty soon relationship it's not really that contentious or anyting and i'm an only child so i don't have siblings i don't have a large family i'm so. in general i'm not really that close to family. one person is my mentor who i met in 2005. and she's a judge and i met her when i was in community college and she really. open my eyes to possibilities and made me feel that i would be able to achieve certain things. is it for you to get it. pretty easy well it's easy for me to sleep what's not easy is getting up. because usually i do not look forward to what i have to do that day and the thought of it is you know just makes me want to stay in bed all so i wake up pretty tired and not really feeling refreshed. i think just. self talk about how would i have to do isn't that bad or that the things that i'm doing now or going to end pretty soon with the end of the school year trying to think of things that i can look forward to in the week also listening to music and browsing the internet kind of gets my mind going. feeling. oh wow feeling emotionally drained in some ways and at the same time feeling like i've accomplished a lot and i've grown so mix of ambivalence and feeling drained and a mixture of. feeling accomplished and proud at the same time. no i haven't. yes. an 2006. the convergence of a lot of stressful factors i was out of touch with my mom i started why i transfer to a university that was pretty rigorous and just all those changes going on really. exacerbated things that were already there depressive tendencies that were already there and it got to a point where i just felt really overwhelmed. yes i do. yes. i notice i'm better able to. accept my emotions and not judge them and also identify them i'm. able to think differently about things that happen maybe look at things in a more positive light. and also identify the areas i need to work on and the underlying issues in those areas. this past weekend i reconnected with some old friends and it was really good to see them and be back in touch again. people have different takes on on me i don't have one best friend but i think people would describe me as very. analytical. sensitive intelligent. intellectual. i wish that i did not order it i wish i was better able to cope with my anxiety and depression which i'm working on and i wish that i had more energy. start going to therapy now. but yeah i really would and. also. to what house am i playing 10 years ago 18 okay so graduating from high school i would tell myself to pick up some more job skills that i wouldn't have to struggle as much in the future and to seek out mentors to get a clearer idea of what i wanted to do as a career. i think the fact that i'm in grad school and coming from the background that i that i come from low socioeconomic status and just pushing through challenges to get here. thanks for sharing your thoughts. you're welcome. bye. okay.,0,0,3,0.6321284,0.3678716,,,,,484
0,3,all right. okay. oh actually before that one thing i almost forgot to do something that stinks. are you okay. yes. i'm all right. los angeles california. the lights big city it's always something going on. the traffic and that's it. business administration and business management. not that about something else i'm doing networking at the moment. to open up a big clothing line and just supply the whole world with clothing. yeah. definitely. i'm all about myself it's all about me. not often but more times than not yeah. being lied to and i guess people think you're dumber than do anything with you are. try to get away from everything going to my own space. very well i'm great at controlling my temper. probably like 2 days ago it was probably just over some sports it wasn't a real argument. not a lot but i travel enough. just being able to get a change of pace see somebody knows he new faces new environment. let me see the last trip i had was vegas you know how vegas cuz it was pretty fun it's a lot of a lot of drinking and a lot of partying going on. i'm pretty open-minded i'm kind pretty much everybody i'm a pretty even-keel guy. it's all right it could be better. no. no ma'am. nope. no. lately it's been pretty tough i guess cuz i've been staying up so late but that's my fault. i don't know i guess i'm a night owl all of a sudden i'm turning into an hour. sluggish and tired all day if i don't sleep well all day i'm just laying around. no not too much. give. stay focused and listen to the adults. yeah. self-explanatory i could have just listen to parents are other adults i tried to steer you in the right way and you know you're being a stubborn kid at that at those ages so it's like why do what are you talkin about i miss my life i can do what i want i don't have to listen to you but now i see that with every telling me was correct. how would your best friend describe. hilarious. are you to your family pretty close. both my parents mother and father. recently did i do a new year's eve party i had thought i had the time of my life it was so fun. i'd love to hear all about. this new year's eve i went to a party at friend's house in baldwin hills area he had it at a pretty nice house it's a three-story house and it was like 350 people in there it was pretty fun but it was also not that fun because it was telling people and you couldn't really move so that was the only downfall of the size that i brought my new year in great with tons of friends and that's how supposed to be done. what are some things that usually put in. i'm generally in a good mood every day i mean waking up with me in a good mood i guess you can say that but i don't know how good a good meal. one of my most memorable experiences are probably when i was younger i was in boy scouts and we should go camping all the time and one year we went to yellowstone or yosemite one of those places and we had to work on a mountain biking merit badge and of course made from the city i'm like a mountain biking i can ride a mountain bike but once we got in the real mountains on got on real mountain bikes i gained a new respect for the mountain bikers it was pretty it was fun and pretty intense going downhill doing about 45 miles an hour and dirt on a bicycle was pretty intense and i was i'll never forget that. i don't know that's a tough one. what am i most proud of i don't know honestly.,0,0,4,0.92694354,0.07305653,,,,,318

2,14,"where's my little button are you bringing okay all right. yeah she looks like human. okay. okay alright okay you're welcome. are you okay with this yes. today is a wonderful day i'm doing just absolutely marvelous. i was born in cleveland ohio i was raised in tucson arizona and came to los angeles when i was 16 years old. yes. i've only been back once since i left. soho another community when i was going up i'm so glad i grew up there because it was a great sense of community which i think we don't have here in los angeles. my grandmother died and left property for my father so we came here to manage her property property. it was pretty easy for me i was still young and it was easier to adapt so i'm pretty good at meeting people that has never been a problem i travel a lot as a child so i was used to moving and going to new places. meeting new people seeing new things it's an adventure and i like the adventurous life. oh one of my best troops i had it was in nineteen i'm dating myself but 1964 i came out here to visit my grandmother from cleveland ohio and i went to an indian reservation and i got a little note card about the reservation when i got back home i wrote to the reservation and i told him i when i went back to school in september i would have to write deliver a speech rather about what i did over the summer and i told them i wanted to talk about going to the indian reservation and what they send me something and they sent me this huge cucina indian down and that was that was a wonderful experience to have the thing is worth now if i still had it i found out like a quart of a million-dollar so. but that's one of the best person. i can be a little bit of both i'm pretty when i have to be i can be outgoing cuz i'm good at talking to people and meet people but sometimes i have a little bashful side-by-side me to the little bit of both. i study business administration with a emphasis in marketing and advertising. i'm really i started in computer science but that was back in the day when computer science wasn't is what it is today and i'd like i was good at it but it wasn't any interaction with people and i love people so i wanted something that would bring me interaction with people so i wouldn't a marketing and i was working for a tv station where i was going to school so that fit in line in marketing advertising so. no now i'm a photographer i'm a celebrity photographer i shoot a lot of stars i shoot on the red carpet i shoot a lot of special events and anything of people will pay me for. it's not hard at all this my passion i love it is like not working. i'm in my dream job i just need to get more jobs that pay pay me well because there's a lot of times as photographer you have to do a lot of things event for free to get known so it's a building process of relationships i'm still in that process of building relationships so that i can get more pay jobs but this is my dream job i love what i do. okay. well now i'm really back into it i used to do it a while that i got away from it but this meditation i practice meditation i try to do it twice a day in the morning and at night before i go to sleep i work with oprah and deepak chopra and anybody else who provides me with meditation and i use that too, bye. i can really control my temper sometimes i get set off i guess like any other human being but i work at trying to keep it moderate and temperate temperature and personality. oh wow we argued with my daughter the other day about something i said and i did not mean to say it to hurt her but it obviously did and we argued about that what my intentions were my intentions were never to hurt her and maybe what i said did and that's what started sergeant. oh god i felt terrible because i never intended to hurt my daughter and i never wanted to hurt her and i feel bad that she had been hurt by what i have said i had to have the guard my word to watch my thoughts. but i don't have much of a relationship with my with my brothers and sisters and mother and father my parents live far away so it's just my two daughters here with me and we have a pretty good relationship you know we try to work my my daughters and makeup artist i'm a photographer so we work a lot together in the industry so sometimes i think we're up on each other to close we need a little more space. yeah when i say the wrong things. no is never easy to be a parent it's like working progress. making the right decisions about things sometimes. the love the show look feeling of accomplishment that you were able to raise the highest creation on this planet to be a wonderful and productive human being. i'm not as strict as my parents where i give my kids a little more freedom to find out who they are i'm not real religious like they do but i am very spiritual so i brought them up different from me on the religious tip and more i listen more to them i think than what my parents did it was you were to be seen and not heard when i was growing up and i let my kids voice be here. what's something you feel guilty about one night i had a bad night that changed my life and i don't want to go into details i feel bad about that night. yeah i could have stayed home. go out and trying to think about it and situation maybe those handling of how i me and my husband divorced i think i could have handled that a little differently. well we we i think we really loved each other a lot and we just it was it was something that had come to an end and the way we separated was kind of explosive and i think both of us could have handled it better but i think i played a part in keeping a lot of drama going because i was hurt that we were breaking up and kind of devastated because i wanted my child to be raised for their father so i think looking back now which is you know hindsight is 20/20 vision i could have handled things a little better but what can you do you do the best that you can at that time if you knew better you do better. tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to. the hardest decision i've ever had the hardest decision ever had to make was i was on my way to work as an enrollment counselor on the plane had a stroke was going to making a connection and to get on the other plane to and then go to the hospital and a doctor was sitting behind me and he told me that i could not get on that plane because i might have another stroke it was a hard decision cuz i was in dallas texas all by myself i did not i mean i was in there with the employee but i would be left all by myself cuz my employees have to go on to montgomery alabama where we were headed and i had to make a decision should i stay or should i go but my life was in the balance so i made the decision to stay and go to the hospital but that was a hard one. overwhelmed i mean here i am on my way to work you know i flew to different state every week and they help kids get get admitted into college and here i am on my way to work and i'm on a plane and i feel this weird feeling coming over the left side of my body and i say my prayers when i go to sleep and then when i wake up to get off the plane i can't remove my luggage from the overhead compartment which i did every week so i knew something was wrong it was it was when you see your life in the whole world in your hand and you don't know what's going to happen next so it was very disturbing very traumatic and you know you don't know what's happening to you is so the weirdest thing riding to the hospital in a medical ambulance that was a weird experience. i'm sorry but i'm here you know i've survived is a doctor told me nobody survives it a stroke on a plane and i survived so universe wasn't finished with me yet. how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep you know it's that sometimes i have a little problem with it sleeping a little bit sometimes i i get wired up i get wired up just because i'm one of those real energetic persons and i have to finish what i set out to do and until i finished i can't go to sleep so sometimes it's hard for me to go to sleep by the time i can lay down and just go but depends on what's going on in my head. what are you. sluggish probably a little on edge but i try to keep a puppy personality i'm really energetic person so i try to but you know if your tired your body is still talking to you so. lately i've been feeling really well except i've been having some problems because i have a since i had two stroke i have nerve damage in my head and in my face and so i just it's i thought it's been over a year since i had two stroke but i thought by now it would have gotten a little better and it has it but i'm so grateful to be alive that that is really my minor compared to the bigger picture and i wasn't fortunately my i didn't lose my facial structure or you know my face is not screwed up like a lot of people are i still can use my hands i still beat you with my camera but my left hand is is diminished and use but i can shoot with my right hand as a photographer so i can still keep doing my work. so you know i have to keep a good upbeat. energies going on for me to keep for me to be successful. no but i went through depression from being knocked unconscious five times and i was a schoolteacher every ball there was that you could name soccer ball baseball basketball name that ball hit me in my head and i suffered from having like sleep apnea not been able to sleep from being hit so many times and knocked unconscious in the head. no only i don't go to therapy because. i don't i don't have any medical right now so i'm not able to get therapy they only offered that to people with medical hard to get it and i'm not work yet sucks i'm not working right now because i'm still trying to get my disability so that i can get well cuz i'm going to be a fulfilled human being and i want to be totally and you know the system it'll be almost two years before i go for a hearing. so that's kind of depressing to think after all the years i've been working since i was 16 and it's taking me it's been over a year or the year i had two stroke february 2012 and we are now in march of 2013 and i won't have a hearing until september 2013 just to tell me if i get the disability or not that's been very depressing for me because i'm wondering where i lived off my savings in the last year and i got put my daughter through college you finished and now she's having to take care of me and she still looking for a job and my life is kind of up in the air right now and some wonder what goes what comes next and so i'm just praying for guidance. i feel happy every day every day i wake up and i can breathe and i can see and i can walk and i can talk and i can still shoot my photograph i'm happy it's just a good thing to be in the present moment and to be alive. and you know what i figured i'd look at it regrets you can't change the past all you can do is change right here and right now so just move for it. what advice would i pay myself don't let anything get in your way you know keep a good personality an energetic spirit and just keep pushing. energetic talkative won't take no for an answer follow through reliable good-spirited giving loving. i'm most proud of that i have been able to find out my creative side i've been a visual artist i never took an art lesson before i taught art i was in my late twenties before i even discovered that i can draw and paint i'm a doll collector i'm at my creative side is what i'm most proud of because it's been able to help me being creative i can no matter what even when i was still very ill from having a stroke i could still go out and just go take pictures and that was so soothing to myself that i'm glad i'm glad that i have a creative side of that i found it and have utilized it. is that it. why. no that was kind of therapeutic that really was therapeutic. go back here okay oh okay i'm

probably should have just let it go with the flow and just see how it turned out. hardest decision i've ever had to make was. man i really don't know actually. having to see my dad go through surgery and see him suffer. well he had a tumor that had to get removed so it's just hard seeing him have to be in the bed and just be in the hospital when he really don't want to be there cuz he's a really

don't i mean they've always been there for me and i appreciate it but we've never had that closed collection connection especially since they're foreign so they don't really understand where i'm

from that we have a decent relationship when we do speak to each other it does it kind of awkward but it's okay. i think they are out of control i think that they're learning things that they shouldn't know at this age i think that they're doing things they shouldn't be doing and i don't feel like enough people are telling them that they shouldn't be doing it i feel like they're being applauded by the media there being applauded by celebrities that they follow. and there's not enough being done about it and they're just getting lost. how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep

getting out of it now so. things are looking up on the bright side. do you still got. i know. why did you stop. they were telling me the wrong thing i didn't want to hear she's not a witch. they said the grieving.. was two or three months seen on had i still think of my dad he died 10 years ago you know i said who who said that i'd be grieving very last that long and they told me to book says that and i said you take your book and shove it. cuz some people some people have to grieve longer than others. just the way it is. do you feel therapy is useful. no i don't think so i think you have to deal with your own problems. if people all people have different problems in my snow. just getting over it. how about getting over the loss of the last 10 years my. my dad my older sister and my older brother my mother and then my wife in the last 10 years it's been tough. it's been real tough on me. i got sick a few times end up in the hospital. i don't go to therapy anymore i can kind of pretty much do it on my own. okay. when was the last time. i feel happy all the time. oh yeah i'm always been a happy happy go lucky kind of guy hanging on but talk to my friends all over the country you know and it said you sound good and that is why i'm good and just you know i got stuck in this rotten pulling myself out and it's just the way it is. a positive influence has been done just do it on my own. how'd your best friend. i seem all time. they just. go along with the flow just like i go along the floor with them they might do stuff i don't appreciate but that's their own life. i'm going on a fishing trip last week out notion. had a pretty good time out there and then midnight go to the drag races see all my friends from all over the country. some. good to see them they're glad to see

freeways crime. yes i do. seeing new places or going back and seeing same places and just enjoying the lacs and getting away from la. wellwood said last trip by made with up to the central coast up in cambria and pismo beach area and solvang standing. yeah. probably a when i got to study abroad in madrid spain when i was a student at ucla. sometimes a child yeah i was i participated in the education abroad program at ucla where you go live in another country to learn language when you live before year after university study at the university and that it was just a memorable year and experience that i would never forget. thanks. probably more shy but the that sometimes i could be outgoing. i'm more shy in terms of being alive. it takes me it takes time for me to get to know people i mean i'm not a real party person i don't like to go to parties and meet people and things like that but if i'm among friends and think like that but i can be for the outgoing. with people i know. the drink wine. yeah i drink wine maybe listen to some nice music. pretty good i can i'm pretty good at controlling my emotions. oh gosh i wouldn't say it was a real argument it was more like a discussion maybe about. finances maybe. money. i was just a little irritated but the not really not really strong emotional. oh. wow guys i can't think of anything at the moment so i'll look for the skip that one. maybe. eating eating more junk food than i admit to. or. the hardest decision i ever have to make. maybe. buying a home buying a home or remodeling the home. spending money for. it was a i felt it was time to move on with my life and to buy a place for myself so i could be self-sufficient and independent. yes very happy. and then i could erase from my mouth when i when i was when i was student teaching for a year trying to get my teaching credential undiscovered i never enjoyed it i want a race that whole year 1983. it just brought back horrible horrible memories of what i went through when i was student teaching in the discovered that teaching k-12 with no not for me. i stood my major was spanish and linguistics. what made you decide. i was very good on languages and i thought them i enjoyed taking them and i was just having a good time taking foreign language and i was getting good grades so i thought maybe this is what i should go into foreign languages. i was teaching i was in the delta teacher teaching english as a second language for 30 years and i just recently decided to retire myself. i have a pretty good relationship with my family with my mother and my sisters and my father passed away in 2008 and my relationship with my father wasn't as good as with my other family members. fucked up on the phone the whole time we have pretty good relation with the with my family now. pretty easy i don't have any problems. if i don't sleep well i'm i may be moving around in the bed and messing up the sheets but that doesn't happen too often. pretty good i think i've been feeling pretty good no major health problems or anyting. no. no. no. last time i was really happy. i probably when spring break came around and with a vacation time and it was time to go on our trip. yeah it was a it was a week trip up to central coast to cambria and pismo beach and santa ynez was just the nice getaway relaxing on the hotel lawn and garden drinking wine and enjoying different sites and eating good food and then buying were going to replenish our dwindling supply at home. i think she would describe me as a kind and sweet and motivated and nice person. oh sometimes i wouldn't mind being a little more outgoing i guess i tend to be more reserved so i wouldn't mind being more outgoing towards strangers and things with. really badly about myself probably when i betrayed a confidence with some friends of mine when i take them when i tape them singing christmas carols and i i played it to some other people and they found out and they really laid a guilt trip on me for doing that. but it all got resolved at the end we all we became we were all hot it was just a bad misunderstanding on my part but it worked out okay. probably having done what i did bikes playing at the other people. what advice would i give myself 10 or 20 years ago and don't give up just keep keep pursuing what you want never never give up with cu does a hint of a disappointment if nothing if it doesn't work out. i'm a i'm a good listener i'm i'm a motivated person i'm hardworking i'm conscientious i'm caring assembly a pretty happy type person. something recently when i really enjoyed. going to the going to the festival of books at usc this weekend. yeah that festival of books is it's a festival where they have all these off authors and they have them food demonstrations seminars and all kinds of books available to look at and there is a lot of food and then a lot of authors signing books and things it's a great event for her to get out and end

to spain and my grandma and my father's mother was born in spain i went back to trace her roots. i spent a week in madrid a week and barcelona and a weekend majorca. had a great time. hydraulic. it was an everyday thing people are friendly finding out some things about my grandmother and her family were interesting. i studied poli-sci and sociology. what's the time it seemed like the easiest thing to do. now now. i have a dream job for a while i was doing sports research for our native american tribes but i enjoyed it but that's so it's not as. as often as it was mainly because of the the sports bureau that exist now that didn't exist when i started. crystal when i do i still enjoy it. i'll be with it but i'll be with suits me in any given situation. you intend i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got. what do you do. listen music. i like oldies jazz soft music. i've learned it well i have a question i was at wayne but i've learned to do it well. might want to bug you a super mean words but with my youngest daughter it was about a year-and-a-half ago. can you tell me about. where was stand over an incident i didn't like the way your husband said something to her and it bothered me and when i told her she got it extremely defensive and rather than deal with her when she became she became angry with me. i was mad. three girls 38-37 31. three granddaughters. 11-14-18 so i haven't won an argument a long time but i adore all six of them. when i don't really consider myself a parent just wanna grow my baby's 31 and you never lose that but i'm in my parenting at this point in my life i'm enjoying my grandchildren when i was a parent that's a difficult job. getting getting to their level and understanding what they understand i don't understand and that putting your your stuff in front of theirs. hugs. well my dad was with physical and those days you know nobody called child services if you got hit. my mother was very loving you but my dad. i adored my mother my dad that was a hard guy but i love him. i never felt abused by him but i mean i'm the one thing i remember you said when you when you're capable of kicking my ass you can leave this house. that's my hope that skyler the bases of a relationship. okay. my mother. my kids my grandkids. i'm one of them one of the three three sons really didn't have any experience with the females other than with my mother in terms of being the unrelated and my grandma and my first daughter was born i was like why was it so i'm madly in love with her. change my life. that's what happened. when my mother got sick i wish i wasn't there for her the way she should have been. but i don't feel good. oh yeah you can always fix what you do with you. i was just in a real bad situation. but that doesn't excuse the fact that i wasn't there the way i should have been. at least i did it my way. why my second marriage probably she she wanted to have children already had my children with my first wife and i had told her initially that i did not want to have children that you know i'm going to head 3 and i was good with that and she indicated that she did not want to have children. so we got married and then her best friend guy pregnant and our relationship changed and. i basically wouldn't relent and we had to get a divorce. i don't know what i would have had to it would have would have had children with her but i. i wasn't very flexible in the process. what to be flexible. sometimes i am sometimes or no. i've been pulled my boy my father out of off of life support. what made you decide to do that i just keep going back to something he said to me when i was younger that he would come back and haunt me and if i do know if i let him lay it lay there and suffer. took me a while to convince my other two brothers but that's what we do. can i get erased from my memory. being locked up for a while like erase it from my memory. it's an everyday hell where there's very little humanity. and you got to do some things that you're not proud of. how easy is it. i've never slept i'm never slept a lot and i'm one of those people that if i wake up i have a hard time going back to sleep so it's best if i'm really tired than you know. what are you. i'm pretty much so with the same oil change. socialite. things are good with the kids and the grandkids except for the live incident with my granddaughter midol youngest daughter but i had a friend recently who was runned over in a crosswalk and then he's on he's on life support simon feeling too good about that it's it's affected me. was like he was jaywalking and he literally was walking in the crosswalk and the guy never even hit the brakes o. and he's on that life support at this point. have you noticed any changes in your behavior or soccer. no not really because that's the thing about me is i'm very inconsistent. no. no. but i've had moments when i thought i was i was depressed okay i was talk to you when you were talking to any other question. yesterday. had a conversation with my 14 year old granddaughter. i'm happy i have moments of happiness everyday cuz i either speak to text with my daughters and granddaughters everything even if we're upset with one another. i have a lot of regrets. can you give me an. i should have went to law school. that's that's kind of something i thought you were going to think about more in my lifetime it was accepted i just didn't i had other other things i thought i wanted to do. i played with those wanting to be a kicker for football on the football team and had some tryouts things like that but didn't pan out. and that is as that didn't pan out i sort of lost my zest for wanting to be a lawyer. we just did other things. i'll take a big that was different i probably would listen to myself. by myself. i could be. if i don't like you i can be very very difficult if i don't like you. i'd very much like to change that. it has in the past year. well i just threw that you can make me feel bad about myself only if i let you and i'm not real big on letting people do that to me on my first wife when when she left me with the children she you know that it was my fault. and i wasn't sure that i believe that but i knew i was an ass and and so i probably believed it and not in its totality but in part. i'm very i'm not judgemental i will listen to anybody but that i agree with you or disagree with you. i've taught myself to. control anger that i that i have. and if if i call you my friend or if i tell you i love you and i mean it that's that's not something that i do. casually. okay why i play 18 holes of golf with it with an old dear friend we got caught up and. 4 hours on the golf course 2 hours at dinner. that is your wife have a good time. a lot a lot of memories came in. why am i not like my grandkids i like that you know i like the hell out of them. i don't have all kids in like that i think they're like too much on that rely too much on technology but. but that's me mainly cuz i don't. but if my grandkids are any any sampling of it i think they're good think they're pretty good. i raised my girls. basically by myself with the help of my mother. i think that's the thing i'm most proud of. okay nice chatting with you. already. starting to run with the high school. good memory. head back over to the

dysfunctional family i really don't have many family values. me and my brother 13 years apart in age so i really don't know my brother that well. so i really don't know much of a family life we never sat down at the table together and had meals together it was always like separate times when we come in and eat another one would come in and eat we never sat down at the same table. so i don't know much about family life. i listen to music. and. i listen to relaxing relaxation music like chimes a brook water running stuff like that. how are you. i'm on medication right now i get aggravated really easily mood swings personality disorder but sometimes it just flares up depending on the situation of somebody gets in my face but i try not to let it happen cuz i know the circumstances. when was the last time you argue with them. wheels on the bus. i was sitting in the back on the bus and the guy came back and he wanted me to move for he could sit down but i'm a big guy and he's a big guy so i decided just to get up and let him have a seat i didn't want to get no confrontation i just let it go. that had to be meeting a girl that i've known for 18 years. she's had two children with this guy and. now the guys going to be part of the family and i feel very comfortable about that. but i still have feelings for this girl but i know that the father of the boys but not married he's going to be involved with the family and i i don't like that. what's something you feel guilty about. that's a good one back in 2010 i went back from my mom's funeral and my brother was hard up for money. and he took his ira out and spend it and i have promised him i was going to pay him back i wasn't able to pay him back and he held it against me so i felt guilty about that because i made a promise and i didn't keep it but there was more circumstances into that and he doesn't understand he didn't write to me he didn't call me he didn't do a lot of things. tell me about the hardest decision. the hardest decision i ever had to make. was when i was with the merchant marines i was very comfortable being at sea. and my wife at the time she wanted me to stop sailing and just get a regular nine-to-five job where i would have been very comfortable staying at sea and working on ships cuz i love that that was what i loved but she didn't like that so she'd rather me work 9 to 5. tell me about new bed or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. dead bodies i always see a lot of dead bodies. i had circumstances in the military where i recovered a dead body in the philippines a boy had jumped ship and we recovered the body underneath the pier and i had to pull the body out and put it in a body bag and another incident was in boot camp. there was a circumstances were me and this guy got letters all the time from our girls but he was engaged and he committed suicide because. the girl dumped him for another guy and a crush them and he end up jumping 3 ft in

15,64,"so when she's finished i'll just wait for a little more buttons not working. i'm pleased. are you okay. yeah go ahead. okay. i grew up in wisconsin and i lived in colorado for a bit and then they lived overseas for a little while and then i move to california. i moved here at the end of june of last year so i guess it's been 8 months something like that. at the most probably twice a year. well my own town is all of 5,000 people and there are a lot of cows and barns and farms so the opposite of la. good question i have always wanted to live in california so but i had to living in in the central coast. and i just have been coming down to la like once a month for different business and that working and personal development stuff so yeah things were changing in santa cruz for me that client i had who is really the main like financial. main financial source i had that relationship ended so i was totally free to move and i thought well i guess i'll give ally a try and see what happens so. i give it a shot and here i am. no not at all very very big city. i lived in dublin in ireland was it which is also a big city but you know european cities are much more condensed and the public transportation is much more easy and. yeah so just getting around here and getting familiar with the city was pretty challenging and. i'm not much of a world explorer. i love to travel i love it i live in ireland and i traveled by the morocco and i was in costa rica on my spend some time in mexico so yeah. i love meeting new people experiencing new cultures and like also not just seeing what's different but seeing what's similar among people everywhere you go. i want to hear about one of your trips. sure well. i guess trying to think which is my favorite time of night there's amazing things about morocco and costa rica both but morocco's incredible it was like 12 days and we went to three different locations we went up in the atlas mountains are beautiful and. yeah it's a really really cool culture that was fun. my trip to ireland i actually visited there which is why i decided to move there so my most memorable moment of that trip probably dozens but the first most memorable moment of that trip was being in a bison and leaving dublin and going to sound to the countryside and seeing how absolutely breathtakingly beautiful it is time is everyone is these pictures of ireland or you know you see in films and it's green and lush and gorgeous but you actually get there and experienced it it's like the pictures don't do it justice so incredible. i might have an undergrad degree in english and psychology and a psychology minor and i have a master's degree in women's studies. no i use my english in psychology i work in marketing communications so actually do sales so yeah the psychology definitely comes in to comes into play and so does my. i guess my undergrad degree in english but really like i took that on and and created something out of it because most people who get an english degree just teach and i i wasn't wanting to teach. what made you decide to do. too cuz i'm not clear on the question. okay. my job. wow. yeah my dream job is. being a. a motivational speaker and trainer and coach. i'm in traveling the world doing that and impacting people's lives and really contributing to people. my relationships pretty good actually i. i just repaired my relationship with my biological mother who would not she was sporadic i saw her sporadically growing up i lived my dad raised me and then he married my stepmom and they had two kids together so i grew up and i consider them like the family i grew up with so but i got in communication with my biological mother. last may and we've been. clear things up and have been in communication since then. well not sure what you mean but if you're referring to being communication with my birth mother is very freeing to just let go of the past and let the past be the past and create something new in the future and they do not just the future but in the present moment with her so yeah. i'm shy. time to relax i do a number of things i like to do yoga and i don't have the money for it right now i love to dance i love to read i love to go to the ocean and spend time just staring at the waves and soaking up all those negative ions that really retarded is my battery actually probably more than anything else. i like to be with friends i love arts and trying new restaurants. yeah all those things are. both relaxing and i guess they're relaxing in the sense that i feel connected to the people in my life and today experiences of my life so. yeah. how are you at controlling your temper. depends if i'm driving not very good but otherwise i'm pretty good at it. last night i argued with somebody probably would have to be. ono is with the la times that the newspaper delivery. yeah that was the last time. tell me about. yeah the newspaper that was supposed to show up for the elderly lady that i take care of it didn't show up and i didn't realize that it wasn't there until. i'm late i don't know afternoon i think early afternoon and then i called them and they said they couldn't send a replacement because it was after 10:30 in the morning which is absurd to me when they made a mistake in the first place so i mean for service at and it would pay for it for every day so i'm yeah i was just really irritated and then i found out that the newspaper had been forwarded to a new address and that had not been communicated with me so amazing ricky l e x i was angry with people who'd forwarded the newspaper and didn't tell me i was pretty frustrated. noel there quite a few of those. i think about 1. the other day i had a phone call. and i'm going to coaching program and. it was from one of the coaches in the program and she was explaining to me that there was an additional call that was going to be we have meetings every week classroom meetings and then we also have coaching calls cuz we have one particular coach we work with and then she called to tell me that i was going to have another coaching call with. someone who's not my couch and that hasn't been explained to me it's part of the program so it's in that moment it just seemed to me like oh my god i have all these people i have to be accountable to and you know i have to not just be accountable to them but share private things that are happening in my life with these people and it just. so yeah i wasn't. i was an angry i was just i just felt frustrated and a little overwhelmed in that moment and i talked it out with her and we got through it but. yeah i could have. certainly just been okay with what for was being asked of me in the at that time and would have made the call go a lot smoother. tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. large decision while there's been a few. why is moving to ireland was probably the hardest decision now it wasn't even the hardest decision it was such an easy decision actually but telling my family about it was challenging. that was the hardest decision was the first time that i. moved away from my family i was 28 and i decided to i chose to move to colorado and that's a pretty tough decision at that point my family had been within an hour's drive of where i lived an hour hour-and-a-half and now they're going to be a 12-hour drive away or a plane right away so that was challenging. oh lots of things. i love colorado colorado is beautiful beautiful state and the weather is so much better than wisconsin and at the time i was very much into rock climbing and there's just a huge outdoor outdoor community in colorado so they were a lot more people who were in my age group and or single that was another factor and we're interested in the things i was interested in so colorado to seem like a really natural fit hell yeah and then i found a job that i liked the pay was atrocious but i found some work that was really rewarding and that all came together just move. how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep. i was totally unrelated question. relatively easily it just depends on like what time i go to sleep if i'm out and i don't get home until 11:30 then. and having to go to bed late and i wake up feeling tired like i feel today but generally i can sleep through the night i've had some pretty anxiety-ridden dreams the last couple of weeks but even so even when i wake up from those are five-star from those i still can fall back to sleep relatively easily. i'm sure they are i mean i'm in another transition state and moving out of. out of the house that i live in right now or take care of an elderly woman. yeah and i just i have to find. the financial means to support me in doing that and it's and she creates a lot of anxiety just didn't her state of being anxious exhausting and i'd really depressing. living with her is pretty hard like it's probably the hardest thing i've ever done and i would never ever choose to do it again if i honestly if i knew what i was getting into i don't think i would have said yes to the situation. i feel trapped and helpless like this nothing i can. no way out of the situation that i'm in no matter what i do it doesn't get any better i did i don't know i'm not getting any kind of work that i want to do and my money's not working at all. so yeah i feel pretty crappy. i have in the past year. oh a long time i was 15 i think 14 so it was over 20 years ago. are you suicidal. you feel down. oh yeah i fell down. i don't actually now. well i originally stopped. with my therapist because we had completed i mean we had worked on what needed to be worked on and i was no longer depressed and and then i began therapy again later on think i wish it was in my early thirties and then i we ended that because i moved to ireland so. yeah i'm in depending on the therapist and sitting on your intention like i i don't go into therapy thinking i'm going to be in this therapeutic relationship for the next 10 years i think that's ridiculous. i think you going to therapy to work on a specific problem and i have a solution and have somebody be your sounding board you can see things that you can't see and. we not work through that situation and come up with. a strategy for notches that not just in creating a solution in that area but also just creating strategies and tools for the rest of your life so that you don't have to be in therapy forever. tell me about the last time you got. can i feel really happy. zoe sierra go. no that's not true it was when i. saw my biological mother which was last may. my best qualities. i'm very strong. very strong-willed. i. very supportive and loving and nurturing i'm easy to be around i'm intelligence. and. is there anything you regret. i don't think so. now. what advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago. don't take life too seriously. how ideal weekend, spend some time at the beach and spend some time with friends. either going out at night you know to a movie or just going out to. a club or bar somewhere that we can just sit and chat and be together maybe go dancing after and sundays i usually go to. and then i have brunch with friends and. may i go home and sunday night and get ready for the next day so. i am most proud of. a few things that mean i've moved to places that i wanted to move to and so i've done things that have really spoken to me and if meant something been dear to my heart to actually. achieve those those. goals are those. yeah i've done things that i wanted to do like move to ireland and move to california. okay.",1,1,4,0.17916055,0.8208394,,,,,377

success and commercialization and that kind of thing so you can keep up the pace. how hard is that that is a little bit harder i think when you first make the adjustment and pretty soon it becomes obvious it's another market that you just have to work hard in my queue you do numbers. what's your dream job. obee credit attorney. why otis because you have the the power you can use the skills to be able to affect people lot of people's lives in a more dramatic way than just being an assistant in that field. how close are you to your family a lot of it is not around anymore just to have

her in beverly hills schools and asthma of those very wealthy kids with hearing name celebrity families whose white chocolate jesse got in trouble for that one sitting and not because she wasn't influenced so that was a really bad time for us. what do you think i think it depends on which neighborhood or state you're in or are they the think there are little misguided as a little tired right now i can throw them away down by the concerns of the wars and and things like that and i think they could probably use that as a common goal a common in our now is he as a separate group that had once they were i think. how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep i worry sometimes about work issues than pretty pretty easy do you feel that way often i don't feel like i'm not sleeping i just know caitlin will worry about nothing work when was the last time that happened a couple weeks ago. how did you feel in that moment i just died you know unfortunately have to worry you don't

realized it was traumatized by having to go through that again we have post-traumatic stress and i couldn't later after the adrenaline dies down the one i understand and so i think it was just stuff it was just kidding me later and i was having a face that paper again. just just extreme you know avoidance of getting something done it shouldn't easy for me and and thinking about it as thoroughly as i should ever studying at are putting it off and putting the feeling of going threw that paper that type of paper you have just a class assignment again. have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughtful. well i'm not lately you know back then for sure when that happened which is about ten years ago now with someone quarterback 7 years ago now and yeah it was it was effective i

20,74,that i am. alright thank you so much rachel. hi i'm ali thanks for coming in today. created to talk to people in his face. i'm not a. are you okay with. sure. i'm fine i'm doing all right. yeah. from maryland. yeah the maryland washington dc area. i like 5 weeks ago. maryland. it's a lot it's a lot less. it's at. it's not as nice this time of year it's more. it's it's good it's nice it's always a lot better though it's a lot it's a lot more people a lot more going on. i'm still i guess i'm still getting used to it so. it's. it's not like. yeah i'm still getting used to it it's coming slowly but but surely. i live in culver city. i do i have one. it's okay it's i live in a really nasty house it's me it's cheap it's cheap cuz i'm living in a friend's place. and. but but if he's letting me stay there for half price but the at the actual like place itself is pretty horrible living conditions but i'm moving inside. i can't see your shoes actually. but no i i travel meet us at met by probably traveled more than most people in the us like considering that most people don't travel in the us but i wouldn't i wouldn't call myself a world traveler. i enjoy the chance to get to like see other walks of life and and and kind of like meditate on the. the specificity of my own you know the the the given the parameters that i grew up under like how different everyone else is like how how every life is totally i mean even just within the us like seeing how someone in california grows up is so different from how someone in maryland grows up and then to think about someone in like thailand or something growing up it's pretty pretty amazing. okay. put me on the spot here ali. let's say. well i. it's been awhile since i've been on a trip i guess one of the last trips i did was to. i made a lot like two years ago i went on a road trip across the u.s. and that was that was pretty amazing saw but i guess the best put the best two places on the drive from maryland to la this is before i actually moved out here but i visited new orleans and new orleans was just this whole like even though it's part of the us it's like a totally it's totally different than anywhere else it's so unique the culture they are so unique and and the blend of like caribbean in french and all these other influences into like the american south is so so yeah it's just it's it's unreal. tough question. what. can you come back to that question are you capable of that. come back to it. yeah so just that. dumb. you know that's actually a question i've been asking myself i knew i know my entire life i've had like phases of interest so when i was like very very very young i was really into like the first phase that i remember was keys and then tools like a girl around collecting keys and then i go around collecting tools like just every sort why the toolbox my parents have told me that i had faced before that with his balls like various balls and then i was really into like insects collecting insects and reptiles and instead like animals and then the dinosaur phase and at a certain point i got really into like rat like music like the first rap and then guitar and then acting and then it's some point in their i i i remember telling someone that right now i'm interested in playwriting and and poetry but eventually i was going to be interested in in. film think i could kind of see the trajectory coming but i don't remember what led me to that conclusion i think i just always i would love to sheltered life as far as movies are concerned i didn't my parents didn't let me see an r-rated movie until i was like in high school of us like and and i never signed a lease on r-rated movie i was also very squeamish like i remember when i was fairly young maybe like 6 i saw star wars the first seen a dark star wars darth vader cracked like brakes a guy's neck at just a little scene bear at the very very beginning and that like freaked me out and i had to leave the room so. i'm not really sure. yeah it's it's it's i'm not exactly sure how i got into film but i've always been fascinated by like how people interact in what like you know acting and stuff something movies in general. i am yes. to be a filmmaker to be able to direct and put together and like i cuz i don't use that word so much cuz i think i think of it more as like i want the opportunity to put together and make movies or to make movies is probably the best way to do it to say it cuz i want you and i want involvement in all the all the processes but. i guess the best parable for that would be a director directing. well it's a lot better when i'm not living with them my. i guess. it's funny you should ask ellie thinking about it a lot lately i think i'm close in my entire family on closest with my dad i get along with my brother and sister you know like but i don't. went away like my brothers in a foreign country right now so i don't have the opportunity to talk with him but like i spend more time talking to my dad than anyone else cuz i feel like he's the most like. of all my family he's the one who most except me in like things positively about me i have like a. a complicated relationship with my parents i met on my family and general. you can put yourself more shy. well on the myers-briggs personality test i'm i'm an extrovert but like since moving but i'm not like. i'm not i probably we consider myself on the scheme of extraversion are on the scale of extraversion sorry i would consider myself extremely introverted. i just i see other extroverts in just a matter who they're around there a little like strike up conversations in a fairly shy person them sort of like or inhibited person maybe. so i like to like. until. yeah but i'm working on it i'm working on it. what i'm feeling. i turn on the fish tank screensaver. hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got. what are you doing. well in the past i would smoke weed but i quit smoking weed so now i do not have a glass of wine and maybe watch a movie i don't have or maybe go like depending if it's like an ant if it's if it's a worn-out sort of stress like i like then i that's what i do but if it's more like anxious type stress i might go on an intense walk don't really exercise that much but i like in a competitive sports and hiking. pretty good. well i always like arguing. i wouldn't call arguing this to losing my temper. i enjoy a vicious debate but i don't. as long as my like cuz i won't like revert to personal you know attacks in my in my arguments i try to keep it on subject and try to explain myself as best i can which can get frustrating cuz i'm not like the best articulator of what i think one of my weekly points i would say. but i but the last time i had a heated debate i think that was not the question. when is the last time that happened what happened i forgot i forgot to mention that that i had a heated debate. last time i had a heated debate. was had a heated debate about the movie boogie nights i didn't lose my temper exactly but i like very extremely passionate about about that i don't think it's like that good of a movie but the two people who i was i was arguing with her saying that it was like one of the like best best movies why did they think it was the best movies. they think that like there's something there's some sort of as i understand it they have. they have a certain they think that the. take all of the stories with in boogie nights they have their own like each of them could be their own separate stories they just think that there's a whole lake complexity of character within the movie and. but somehow like. what were they saying they were saying like the movie. it's like it's like the end of an era which makes it look kind of like casino and there's this attention to detail of of the in the different character like how they how they interact in the plot kind of like. yeah i guess i think the heated debate became about like that so from there and like personally it's not like a bad mood or anything but it's the i just don't think dirk diggler is like that like me meaning full of a character like i like it the way i come out i came out of the movie cuz i had seen it before many years ago night at my opinion of it is basically the same even though like i remember it like in watching it again i was able to re-evaluate it there's nothing bad about the movie there's nothing i like articulable about that sleeps has a good solid acting you know the directing is good the camera moves are cool that you know it's cool it's but but it's meat for me it was like meaningless and then two and then they were that let us to discuss the movie that i recently that i really did like his django unchained and they both saw that movie and they hated that movie and then there was the sixth street i get the heated part of the conversation came about like so in the mood. django unchained you have django and jango's like it kind of has a two dimensional character but i don't think that that necessarily takes away from what the the big the big purpose of the movie is and you have dr. king schultz who's this who's this like his mentor character and the person i was arguing with was saying that he was intelligent and so and because he was intelligent there's no way he would have risked his life to save django or like would have gone into this like second act where they go and they go to the plantation to deceive django's wife excetera and and the reason for her giving that argument which like either you buy that he would do that or he wouldn't but the reason for her argument is that an intelligent person would not. sacrificed himself for someone else which straight which strikes me as so like. like who like she's her bit her basic argument was that like altruism doesn't it cuz it was too. i even ran type of argument altruism doesn't exist the only the only thing you can do is sit like the only thing people do is serve them self so it's not quite iron man but it's like the only thing that people like old people are out to serve himself which i'm not arguing that like every decision has like a mix of altruism in and something like even the most altruistic type decision there's maybe like kernels of self self interest in there but she made it sound like self-interest was the only motivating factor in an in like what but what how how horrible is your life if that's like what your ultimate. hurt like if you can't like love and sacrifice for other people so let it to an extremely passionate debate and somewhat like yeah it is said that. so so yeah that that i guess that's the i don't think i necessarily like lost my temper i think i'm losing my temper is being more. like i just i would. revert to ad hominem like attacks but i didn't like that's not maybe i was like maybe i was criticizing her worldview but i wasn't like well you're an idiot you know like it wasn't it didn't it didn't turn into abuse of any sort yeah i'm glad you understand. an event or i don't know if i necessarily would want to erase anything from my memory i would say an issue that i have is not being able to remember in as much detail as i would like to remember feelings and moments not stories like my life doesn't always think together until like a coherent story it's like this moment in that moment in this moment in that moment yeah. tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. the hardest decision i've ever had to make. ouchies. could it just be one of the hardest decisions. choosing between two things that it's like. i guess i'm having a hard time recalling a moment where i like had to choose between. two options like no there's no like sophie's choice type moment in my life. but i but i do think that the decision cuz i lived in new york for a while i went to school in new york and the decision to leave new york after having lived there for five years was it was very very difficult. and but i had to do it for money reasons and because all of my all my core group of friends were either likely were muslim we're leaving and going other places in the world and then the one other person or as close to it was living with someone who i did not get along with it all so it's like the situation where i didn't lose either going to live with people who i wasn't his clothes with or craigslist or or move home and i think it was a tough decision to to leave that the only way i could do it i had to justify it by saying that i would be moving back to new york with in like a month or two which wasn't which didn't end up happening but that was the only way that i could leave new york. you was how hard was that or how hard is how hard was that. it was it was just a very like isolating ice is also like i'd felt like previously to that time i'd fallen in love with one of my closest another one of my close very close friends and. that had kind of gone extremely. badly and so i wasn't on speaking terms with her and i couldn't like that whole everyone on my list of friends who was like closer to her her it was quite like her me type thing but that that was the way that i kind of. saw it at the time so i didn't like you know just being socially isolated. yeah. how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep was recently it's been awful. i like to eat so the last last night i slept for like 10 and a half hours which seems to be the length of time that i have to sleep in order to have really vivid dreams but previous to that night. so last not last night but the night before last and the night before that i got four hours in 2 hours of sleep cuz i was working on sat and i would get back and either and i just like couldn't fall asleep for whatever reason it's. too much roundup energy or something i don't know. tired very. not immediately i just initially upon waking up like i really enjoy being up in the early morning. and i also stopped drinking caffeine like i've had like a little bit of coffee the last two days but before the last two days i hadn't had any coffee in like three and a half weeks so. i guess with with caffeine in my system i'm ready to i'm ready to go without caffeine it's i'm just i'm just quieter i guess. more introverted. since lake lately is in latin. changing my thoughts yeah i mean i guess when having just moved here and there is a. of time like at the beginning where the. the sheer difficulty of finding a job and finding people. they moved here cuz i have a group of friends here or couple of friends i don't have like a large number friends and the the push 2. to get out there and meet people and find a job and that sort of pressure is pretty overwhelming at first and i think that i'm slowly like. coming to terms with that. and moving in a moving past it at but not like it's still it's still there the pressures there but i'm just you know. you know you know you know. no i just. nope. the last time i felt really happy. might have to reach back. i think the last time i felt really happy. was during the writing process of salt last year i shot a movie co-wrote co-directed co-produced. and that was kind of like that it still consumes my life but i think that during the. writing stages of that movie in which we would like get up eat breakfast bunker down work really hard put stuff up on the thing just like pure creative. energy between me and the person riding it in. and there is like probably like a good day that i remember where it's just i remember going to bed and i was just so thrilled to be working on when i was working on and and and working with the person i was working with and like. just like. i felt like it yeah i guess that was the the last time that was that was like more than a year ago though but i guess it's hard it's hard to think that i haven't been really truly happy since then but when you're making a movie like you don't you can't allow yourself to be happy especially if you're doing it basically by yourself with with like kind of like you can't too much else to do. i would say that i'm very. except like accepting of other people and always very empathic. and. open like. excited about new ideas and open to new ideas and. yeah. i guess i wish i was last. less ruled by fear more more fearless in my you know. everyday in our actions and in my like. you know. zest for for living. yeah i. i got other things i would change about myself i would i would. i don't know. really badly about myself. i need a renewed numerous instances in my childhood in which my like like every single time there was an issue at school or some sort of. some sort of. conflict with a teacher or anything my parents were always. always on the other side of the court you know like never it was i noticed. or noticed as i got older that other people other parents were like at their kid was in trouble like there's something wrong with with like their kid was perfect there something wrong with other people but my parents were it was always the opposite in particular my mom sorry it said that there are a couple of instances in which. i was like blamed her like you know. it was my was my fault when. when what i was doing it like. yeah yeahs think things things that i couldn't like. no yeah i don't know. yeah. 10 years ago. stay steak unit like i i think that there is. i have a tendency to. like i'd love to love the fact that i have a tendency to get really caught up in id in an idea in like devote myself entirely to it but sometimes. ideas are too easily decided to say like do as much as possible like don't don't decide that you. are only going to do one thing try to like i guess i would have taken up like some taking piano learn learn to read music would be a big thing for me learn to play the drums would have been drums more than reading music i would say i'd love to learn how to play the drums and maybe done more like acting classes. as far as like cuz i was always really into directing so he's directing actors and stuff but i didn't it's only now that i i don't know i guess. stay. don't stay stay stay yeah i don't know that's a tough tough tough question la. that's it. sure. goodbye. but. all right. experience with ellie.,1,1,4,0.2579812,0.74201876,,,,,380
21,81,yeah there's also on craigslist so that's why. okay. how are you doing today i'm doing good thank you. i'm from los angeles. i'm great. i live in west los angeles the west side. it's all right. i live alone so. i love it i'm from here so i grew up here it's natural. the weather on the weather. it's always good you never never bad there's always something to do really dull moment. traffic. the traffic is horrible i'll probably traffic is horrible in almost any major city but i hate the traffic. not really i mean i have enough things going on here so if i travel it's usually somewhere this within driving distance. i study business i didn't. no i've been done for a few years so i haven't gone to school for a while one of these days i'll go back to graduate school but. my dream job would be to just work for myself and make some money. i don't know i don't really have a dream job just something that i can i can work under my own terms and get paid decently and being a creative creative environment. i don't know i think it's just a matter of finding the right situation so right now at its people are a little conservative about what they want so and how they wanted it so it's a little tougher than it should be but i don't know i think when the situation is right i don't think it's too difficult. yep. i work as an administrative assistant through a temp agency so. i just basically has to get sent out to do to do desk jobs. yes or no i mean i feel like i feel like i could do more but now it works so. i'm pretty close there around so. i really mad. stupid people just basically doing doing anything to annoy me. that's because that's the big thing just irritating stupid people just do things just to provoke provoke me for no reason at all. what's a good example. this random people who think it's funny that just sit there and get a rise out of me just it doesn't have to be one any specific situation it's just people who just think it's funny that i think they're just generally sadistic and they just think it's funny to it just probably like it's like poking a stick and an angry dog knowing that they know how they just want to push your buttons for no reason so. i don't remember what those situations i usually try not to remember when it happens i just i just let it go and just like the past of the past i tend not to look back. what do you mean. okay. at what i do to relax i like to run i like to go to the gym. listen to music a lot of musician's friend so i just i'm usually around musicians so anything of that sort i like i like everything from lockhart to tattoos to just anything that's that's generally art and creative. who's been deposit. they just friends and general who received the we seem to do well and i think they are very inspiring and. which is sometimes a little bit tough and in a town like los angeles where i think everybody is on the go trying to accomplish their own goals so they don't it's sometimes hard to find someone who is going to be uplifting or try to be inspiring so. i don't really have anybody in particular but people kind of brought up things here and there. yeah it's like hey instead of instead of doing this how about doing that or egg you're good at this why aren't you doing that or something like that just now i'm always looking for new opportunities so they always point out things that maybe i might i can do differently instead of just being negative thing hey don't do that that's no that's why you doing that it's a waste of time. i guess it depends on who you talk to. i'm okay at it i can probably work at that i don't know i mean i can i think i can do better. go back to the point about people provoking me so i mean i try not to blow steam and let them get under my skin so i just usually try not to let it get to me but i don't know i guess what temper is it depends on how i handle my stress lately i've been better at it just because i think my situation has been a little bit better. now. now. no. nothing major and maybe when i was younger i could have traveled more i could have worked towards something that paid better job-wise but i mean those are all things that i think at any point in life you always think like why could have should have would have done but you know. but then again i think that's natural for anybody i mean i could i could have become a banker or i could have become a lawyer or doctor made. 10 times the money that i make now but but then again i don't like law and i don't like madison so so it wasn't meant to be so. yeah. i think. i think my in my life i knew that there's a lot of things i have there's more things in life so i kind of narrowed it down to what am i good at and what am i not good at and what am i going to work well or who am i going to work well with and i not work well with so i kind of i kind of sort it out and then the list kind of. i'm kind of answered itself so. no it's i don't think it was hard but it was just but i think it was a real reality check and i think it's it's kind of a good thing cuz sometimes trying to conform to doing things that doesn't really fit you doesn't make sense it's like trying to shovel around peg into a square square hole and it's like it just no matter how you try to shove it in it's not going to go and so sometimes it just might as well go down a path that seems to work better for you. memorable experiences. i think it's just i don't really have like anyone in particular i think i think every day is almost like a memorable experience whether it's positive or negative i think it's just everything from getting it just the fact that. i got a job and i can i can take care of myself is already almost like a memorable experience maybe for the average person as it sounds stupid but you know i think just the fact that i'm able i'm able to get this far in life without completely self-destructing is already in accomplishments so i feel like. i gotten somewhere. maybe not tonight maybe not to the point to the average person they might think like well why aren't you a millionaire but you know what not everybody can be a millionaire. yeah. i want the last time i really felt happy. i don't know i'm not really someone who is like. i don't have any real high highs or low lows i mean i haven't hit any lowe's so i mean. i don't know i'm usually pretty i feel like i'm a level person and i'm pretty everyday i feel like if i accomplish one thing that i'm pretty happy so i guess the answer the question probably. probably yesterday i just feel like if i if i'm able to accomplish something then then hey i'm happy. no i don't really have a best friend but i mean well dance a question generally friends. i think they would say that i'm very outgoing i'm pretty determined. i'm trying now i tried i try to interact as much as possible i'm always out networking as much as possible so. i don't know i guess that's basically what i think they would describe me is.

27,102,therapy like this instead of fun. with a live human to put all the nfl teams out of business. because provost. i don't think it's good sometimes i think people might talk to a stranger better or more open than to. if it's someone that might just go buy a couple questions might judge you or for opinions of it's a virtual human being in might be a little less biased also. and nothing's great idea. we could sit at home and do this instead of a going into an office. now she is. that she can have it. thank you very much. how do i know what does she going to say the end of session or okay. i'm a sheep but also i'm going to actually have to go grab a tissue. oh i'm sorry. not at all. sorry about that. hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today. creative. i'm not a therapist. are you okay with this p.m.. i feel pretty good i'm wide awake i had any good breakfast and a nice cup of coffee and i have an easy day today so i am just going to chat with you then i'm going to the gym and run some errands so i plan on having a nice day today. originally. i was born and raised in los angeles and i'm one of the few locals from around here and i went to school away and but i'm one of the few days that are actually in los angeles. yes i am. i like the weather having a vacation house in another state that i found to be too hot and humid in florida i love the weather here i like the cultural diversity i like the familiarity i like that beaches basswood like the chest an hour and a half away one can go to the desert palm springs palm desert but also another hour and a half two hours away and go to arrowhead or big bear and go snowboarding or skiing or things like that and i think it's a great place to live. well maybe some of the things i don't like that i like your say california in general say like the high tax rate which the state tax rate is up to 13 points something out which is going to chase business out of here also the regulations i'm a small business owner so all the regulations are clearly affecting business so many of my peers have been their businesses to taxes arizona nevada excetera some the other western states that are less regulated and that's a good problem here and california. it really does muscle don't understand it but it's also. yeah besides the high taxes you know there's a big immigration problem which being born and raised here most people don't see that but it's a big tax on the social service system and that's what make our taxes so high until they really secure the borders and get that taken care of. so that's how you know but people don't seem to want to really deal with do you want that but it clearly affects businesses because from all the other things that's why our taxes are so high in people are moving out of state. i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot i enjoy traveling got into 66 countries. and i don't travel as much as i used to but i've traveled quite a bit and i just learned a couple of languages and i surf i'm sorry. i didn't really understand that your question. when you said like what i don't think you understood what i said but i'll just go back and. i've been all through europe eastern europe asia south america north africa and i enjoy that and i enjoy the warm climates now especially where you can go and relax where is warm water to surf the cold water kind of makes my back stiffen up and i also like to exercise surf and do yoga and workout and i try to eat healthy and that's a big part of my life. i love to hear. what are my favorite trips of all time where they used to when i was younger see how many countries i can do in a relatively short. of time saying it three or four weeks span but about 10 years ago we actually went to paris and stayed for about a week and really got to know the city even though i've been there about 10 times we got to know the city really well which was great really live like a local and rent a small flat cooked and did our own shopping but really haven't been there so many times it really never stayed for more than 3 or 4 days it was fun to stay there for about you know almost a month and i really get to learn the city and it was fun even though i grew up in la i grew up taking french which there wasn't a big spanish speaking population when i when i was younger my mother insisted that all of us kids take french in the spanish would have been a lot more valuable but i took french all through elementary junior high. tienda high school so it's nice to practice my french even though i don't remember a whole lot and even though it's dad speaking french with the french you know my accent isn't the greatest ever a couple of sentences they start talking english to me. so that was out. i have a few different degrees. so i was a naval science major as an undergraduate. and that was fun and i also have a master's degree in economics. and i've degree in crisis management. i found them interesting and. just something that i wanted to do where i went to college i went to the naval academy i'm up there to play sports and i found it real interesting being from southern california going to school on maryland and i originally want to be a doctor but. which start going to school for a little bit you change your mind excetera so. are you still working. i'm actually in the wholesale business now or wholesale distributors of furniture products and it was a family business but i went to work there a number of years ago when am i grandfathered recently father passed away so i was going to run up a tirol family business and it's pretty interesting i like it having grown up around it but different other jobs out of the past. actually probably my dream job i enjoy cooking and staying at home and. i would probably like to stay home and raise kids because i do have one daughter and you didn't get to spend as much time with her when she was younger as i would have liked but i think i would be better than say a lot of women i know that want to work i actually like cooking and hanging out around the house and taking care of kids you know that i like doing it always on a part-time basis but it seems like boy that would be fun to stay home and not do that having pretty much worked for most of my life so i'll probably never happen but it sounds something that to me it would be fun. do you consider yourself more shy. i think i am generally more reserved and shy with strangers but when i get to know someone or feel comfortable i think i'm more of an extrovert more strangers might think i'm more introverted but i think when i feel comfortable with certain people and i don't know what it is i can meet a stranger and be totally confident or people i might have known for years either from a personal or business situation. and be more introverted i just go with the dynamics but i think my outward manifestations to be a little more shy generally and he's like use the term reserved. okay. sometimes when i'm feeling 10 i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got. oh wow that's a great idea i used to have that on one of my guy with several computers at home and i bet you speak one of my screen savers as well when i need to relax or had a stressful day or stressful personal events exercise will there be yoga or going for a long walk or going to the gym or going for a run or tony the beach yeah maybe going surfing of the weather is warm i don't start from cold weather anymore cuz it makes. because mike a brain freeze you not surf you know if over 30 years and exercise helps me relax the best or sometimes just vegging out on the couch in front of the tv i find relaxing. i like that screensaver i used to have that on one of my screensavers at home. that was that was it but it's one of the things that took me a number of years to master that were my relaxation skills apart and have them the best of my twenties but over the years i think i've gotten better. i think that's a key thing i think as we mature as we learn how to do that i wish i don't have to do that and be a little more hadn't had those skills earlier. i like to think i'm pretty good i think i'm a lot better as well as that as i've aged you know i i am more likely to think before i speak now whereas a 20 years ago is more likely act before i thought so my dad said more things that i would ever attend situation where their personal or a work situation but i've never had a violent temper but i would have a temper where fly off the handle instead of taking a deep breath and really reflecting on it i think i'm a lot better at that now that i was saying my teens or twenties. i think a lot of that comes out here or there is maturity. oh wow you know i really had an argument with anybody in somali what i would consider it traditional. argument probably my ex-wife a number of years ago. we had an argument basically just over my daughter and it wasn't anything violent but it was heated just basically one of the reasons we weren't married our values are so different just our ideas of parenting and just. outlook on life was so different nothing that cost us the butt heads but it's just i know if i caught an argument but it was more of just one of those let's agree to disagree but heads some. i felt like i was talking to a wall and i actually felt more mad at myself that i should have learned earlier in life that boy that before you get married to someone else folder with them that's the kind of discussions that people usually have but you're not really thinking about that because sometimes or younger work looking at boy how does that i look great on paper to her and she look great on paper to me i'm pretty easy-going i have different ideas on raising children have she did and it was more not that she was wrong and i was right not that i was right she was wrong it's just how we raise our different views and we never really. discuss those things but it was really just fundamental reasons on why we butted heads weren't really a good match whereas other things look good on paper to both of us. tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differ. find recently my father passed away recently. thank you and. really because in our religion you plan a funeral very quickly united typically within a couple of days and i really only invited very very close friends and family members has more or less sort of in charge of it my dad is were married but it was sort of not really up to it so i took care of it and i wish i had invited a. i kept it very private and really just told people after the fact that he knew that would have liked to have come to the service and been known about it so i really know he invited because just before the time pressure really just a handful of people but now it's times past i wish i invited more of his friends instead of just two or three close friends you have 10 or 20 points is of people he knew you from business or over the years and i really just an even distant family members i really just told after the fact i really didn't invite him this i was under a time pressure but i could have easily have done it via email or turn to call everybody personally but i wish that some things people have expressed a little. they're upset with me one my other family members through it all back at me all you can tell me till after the fact that you know someone serve it passed so they all through the media so i was more or less. doing this i wish i did that differently but i did the best i could at the time so i'm not really mad at myself that's something i probably should have been more prepared for all service it was something that was coming was inevitable so. my boss my parents are recently. deceased in the last couple of years and had a brother that i've three are brothers one of who passed away in december. and we're not super close like i always like i look at other families we were just never liked that norman rockwell painting because we're all so different and i have a closer relationship with friends and a more distant relationship with family not that it's strange but i wish it was more like boy one of those families i got together every sunday and had dinner and all that we just never did that because we're all also a different. i understand. that's just how it is but you know the strangers most of us how to use family everybody's great you know but i think every family has their own sort of. nope i thought probably i could have had it before from. some other events in my life and i just wasn't sure i've had been to some therapy in the past just from. you know i was in the military and i was never really sure if that that's exactly what it was but i think i function. pretty well but i just wasn't sure that i had been nesin therapy and counseling over the years. i should decide to enlist in the military didn't enlist as an officer. i want one of the service academies. 17 i started after high school and went to a service academy. so it's more prestige this isn't enlisting it's the hardware i want to sell her to school in america to get into. i was but same age as everybody else and went there. did you ever see ko. we did. 1983. just basically wasn't anything intense was just weird just around since we were just we weren't allowed to carry ammunition we were just our positions were just shelled at the time and poison gas was sprayed on us. so that was a i was at wasn't anything too too intense with lot you know he just fits the service i was in the training is way more intense in any actual combat situation. that's because they train you will like you practice harder than you play ignorant ass like he play football practice harder than you actually playing the game the same with. you know if you're in a combat unit. all right baby more patriotic having grown up. in california where people were from all over the country and i got to meet us most of see my friends who grew up in an affluent los angeles like i did never really went out and met a lot of american some people from different backgrounds and ended up becoming. just more patriotic a deeper sense of pride in the country what is really don't grow for that in southern california where someone in texas or kentucky or tennessee or georgia north dakota south dakota montana. it was up with that kind of pride so i thought it was getting and unlike somebody my friends that they don't know what he's there's any life between malibu and manhattan. i went to graduate i was still in the reserves but i went to graduate school. and i got to graduate degrees and i'm at work in private enterprise didn't care for it that i join the fire department as a firefighter and paramedic for a number of years and. then after i got divorced it was hard to do the custody situation with my daughter so into work in the family business that's pretty much my career in a nutshell. at first it was difficult because i just had such a bearing in my butt from the way i walked i talked and i guess i was an officer you were very regimented on the way you dressed in your private time it was harder to be a while to be able to come back to los angeles. i guess i was just so so different i think i handled better than most i have a stronger personality. so but it's a great experience. it all depends if i exercise regularly and i don't eat too late and things are going well in my life i generally sleep pretty well. even though i might have to get up and go to the bathroom once during the night now but i generally sleep do i sleep pretty well. i feel pretty good lately you know i've been like anybody else more periods of blowing your life but the last few months i feel great pretty much. no not really i seem like i seem a little happier and more content lately. okay. have you been diagnosed with depression i thought maybe in the past said you have a family history of it and you know it wasn't anything real to debilitating and i wasn't able to really function on my own but i was concerned with it and sought counseling. i do i was really against in the past and until after i went and then i wish i went more save during my. my marriage or the course of my life now i think it's very useful however in the past i was one of those i grew up hearing that it was just ridiculous and it was a waste of money excetera but i think it's a useful tool that you're open to it. it's just a question. i want to just an honest opinion outside of friends or strangers from a professional you know about life relationships and sometimes it's good talking things out with a professional even though i wouldn't see somebody like you and realize i'd prefer some of his older than i am a little more life experience and some of his may be younger. so but yeah i think it's a useful tool and i really did a 180 switch on that. i don't know now i'm started taking a break from it but i'm not against it if i have some issues i want to bounce off i give someone that i can go to. i think it's nice you know they really if you got to someone who's good and it could have been that few different people at start a therapist shot they really don't tell you what to think which i think it's great you know that's the passage to help you talk through your your thoughts. and you're feeling to let you decide yourself but bring a little clarity to the situation that's why i like. talking to someone with a lot more life experience. and i generally feel more comfortable talking to a woman about that stuff to take to a man. so but it's. i think it's a useful tool i got some good ideas and was able to slice bouncing some things off totally some of these unbiased is not in your day-to-day life instead of talking to a romantic partner or close friends whenever you but sometimes bouncing the people off of stranger is good. last time you felt really high. all this morning i know this this is weird them clearly someone and i'd say this is a joke to my friends and family and associates it clearly haven't having an easy day today cuz i knew we had a nice weather and i have much of errands to run and i clearly have seasonal affective disorder but i woke up so happy today when i know it's going to be 80 degrees out and when the weather is nice i'm generally a lot more happier than when the weather is dark and blue and rainy and called where i always i know that time so but i'm just what i woke up really happy today but then it's going to be a nice day. i look forward to feeling the sun so. most of my friends i'm sort of a renaissance man i know a little bit about a lot of subjects i'm too smart for my own good. and i'm off. i know a lot a lot a lot a lot of pretty things i'm pretty rational i'm very resourceful people always call me when they have issues and i'll talk them through it or resource won't tell them where to go whether it's where to buy a new computer or buy new car or. you know i'm great with medical diagnosis. and people say i'm a lot of fun and fun to be with and. i also have i don't have a lot of grey areas people either really like me or don't like me to meet the things are pretty much black and white. i am what i am i don't bs. yeah i'm the opposite of a politician. i don't tell people what they want to hear to be rude not read anybody but call things as i see him that's pretty much. really said you everything tactfully. okay i like to think i do. i wish ice bobby spent more time with my parents before they passed but it's busy i probably wish i was able to spend more time with my daughter when she was young. but just one of the three typical. really to think things through a little bit more be a little less impulsive or pretended to be more impulsive when i was younger than i am now. i think that's that's it and it would look at things in the long-term instead of looking and things in the short-term you make decisions or choices. what are you most proud of in your life. i'm proud of my daughter she's nice young lady i am proud of my public service i've never done a job really for money of my military service and fire service there very few people like me who did it or is that the background and education that i did but i like public service. and some proud of all that i'm proud of all the certificates i have hanging on my walls and how many degrees it's sort of like trophies i'm proud that they be able to stay in really good physical shape over the years and. knock would maintain good health. it was nice meeting you. bye-bye thank you. how was i. what does old-fashioned you know like mom.,0,0,4,0.9471534,0.05284664,,,,,364
28,104,wow. okay. i broke it. not so good. okay. all right questions and then when she's done she should say goodbye and you can press this button. okay. okay. should be how good. yes. i'm doing pretty good. originally i was born in denver colorado. i like the beach sunshine. pretty girls. the ocean. other things. smog. excess amount of people in traffic that can be dealt with. i would like to travel more. seeing new things and and learning perhaps if you culture or something. oh okay i when i was younger i went to europe and just did the backpacking thing. backpack around europe for a little while and it was it was real fun. i'm probably just being in the military with some friends and stuff like that. why have a degree in film and i'm finishing a degree in or for business as well. now i look for work i'm trying to do some sort of entrepreneurial effort now as i finish my business degree. it'd probably be to own my own company that's kind of why i want some sort of entrepreneurial effort to push push for with some sort of interesting product or service that i'd be working in. i would say middle of the road a little bit shy and at times can be takes a while to warm up. are you cautious to meet someone new and then from there. i kind of see where to go from there i guess. my family they still live in colorado their interesting people and good as well as i talk to him. pray couple times a week they're good people i have one brother and he has a couple of kids and that he's married as well. that's a good question lately i've been trying to get a daily amount of exercise like jogging or riding a bike and recently got a bike. something like that on a daily. effort. for the most part pretty good i try to if i have an outburst or if i'm being irritable i try to stay away from people who didn't like to go off on people they didn't do anything wrong. edward change the topic in my mind i guess. what gets me in trouble would be more i avoid things and it kind of builds up and becomes worse. and that kind of gets the trouble and. basically just in a relationship with a girlfriend. to be honest with that it remember exactly what it was about it's just probably in one of us is being irritable and me and. going from there or it's probably a lot to do with the money as well i don't have the best financial security at this point. that's a good question. oh my i guess i i do harbor a little bit of guilt from the military as far as getting out and people are still in i suppose i know that's it's not for me anymore. only thing well i i used to work at for a friend and i invested into his company. and the economy went down was a construction accessory company basically and kind of movement down and we lost most of our money like most of the folks around america and that pretty much. it was a good and bad thing is you got to look at it from a good good perspective but it definitely put it myself into talespin i financially and couldn't really do anything about it almost was homeless for a little while. but i i wish i wouldn't have invested into the company and just move forward and. perhaps going to school like i'm going anyway. i have. i was 21. i wanted a change in life i wanted some more real-world experiences. answer my country and also the added benefits of going to school or nice i didn't have. much financial capabilities at that time and i wanted to change to get out of my current situation and that was the best way out i thought. are you happy. yeah yeah i'm very happy i join the military i appreciate it now more that i mount and understanding kind of what i supposed war was about it is definitely changing people and myself as well. yeah i did a tour both in iraq and afghanistan as well. see i thought at first it was very easy and then i came to understand he was very difficult. just because i was adjusting from military life and still having that in my head and not until now i realize that i probably just a few months ago. to reno reintegrate myself a little bit better and choose civilian life which it's it's actually it's actually pretty difficult. no problem. movie think i when i got out of the military. versus i'd i invested like i said into my friend's company and we started that little business we're doing well for the while working and then lost all of our money. and then i traveled for a while at a gender stand now is obviously some other issues but i traveled all over america good working and went to school in new york for a little while. lived in a few different states and came back to california where i'm finishing school finally. living the dream. that's a good question i would say. well it didn't and instills you with with very good i think since of. sense of character and strength and you know i think there's a lot of good qualities that the military are military puts a new people but at the same time it puts a lot of bad qualities. as well because you need some sort of edge or something that you need on on am almost daily basis and if you don't get that then in a lot of guys do you know turn into drinking or drugs just cuz you can't get that same edge. and that really that can really either hurt or benefit you. i've been feeling okay i've had a bit of a sinus issues lately but i've been feeling okay. actually i have my my thoughts i used to really have scattered thoughts. and. i would say i'm starting to get a little bit better clarity which is good. taking a lot of different therapy and stuff like that and it it's actually helped. it's it's very as i can't really let the tough part for me is the schedule because that's if i'm not tired you don't sleep you just lay there. it's hit or miss really some nights i can sleep pretty well some nights i have to wait till i'm exhausted. and i don't like doing pills. pills are bad i didn't understand that but it's basically just can't sleep because either you're on my mind is always thinking about something or something i feel that i have to do but yet i'm not doing anything that's not true trying to always do something or do you have some some troubling dreams at times but that doesn't really negate me from sleeping and wakes me up is what it does because it can't be that the dream that you remember versus the one that you don't. when i don't sleep well. perhaps your ability and anxiety definitely go up i i definitely get i have a tendency to get a lot of headaches. and not sleeping very well definitely puts that into the mix. i have. not that i know of no. i i don't know i try to feel happiness on a daily basis i guess what you could answer but i'm not certain. i'll say my my dad's been a very positive influence. that's a good question charismatic her funguy pretty tough. a good worker. i'd say i really enjoyed jogging. the other day on the beach. something that i am most proud of i would say i'm actually an online minister as well and i married my brother and his wife and that was a pretty proud experience. all good. she said goodbye. okay.,1,1,4,0.18238136,0.81761867,,,,,617
29,108,suffice a take off your top will she do it. okay she's kind of hot that's my kind of woman. alrighty then thank you. yes. i feel great. i am from los angeles california. the weather. the opportunity. and the ocean. it's over crowded. overpriced. and somewhat dirty. i have. well it's nice to see other places in the world and to meet other people and cultures. i worked on cruise ships as a musical entertainer and traveled to alaska the aleutian islands korea-japan and the caribbean islands. being in galena alaska and being on a small airplane and traveling in a snowstorm and surviving. like i was on the edge of death and life but i lived. the arts and business. i don't know i was attracted to the arts at a young age and business went along with it. are you happy. yes. yes. to be able to entertain people and make them feel emotions and make enough money to have a comfortable life. more outgoing. i always feel feel very confident with my thoughts and i like people to know what i have to say. i listen to music and i sit with my girlfriend and she calms me down when i'm stressed out. i could work on that i'm not very good at that. last night with my girlfriend. she was asking my advice on something and as i was speaking to her she felt my tone of voice was too loud i was not angry but i was irritated that i was being told to quiet down when i didn't really want to help i just wanted to relax. i agree. sometimes when things don't go my way i get depressed or upset and i wish i could come down and just realized that i should count my blessings and look at the bright side of everything no matter how bad things get always look at the bright side that's my goal. it's been very difficult but i'm working on it and it seems to be getting a little easier. well i when i was taking care of my mother and she was dying of copd and then it turned into lung cancer i chose not to tell her that her condition had worsened so she wouldn't be fearful and i had to sit knowing that her symptoms were getting worse but i couldn't tell her the truth and i let her think that everything was okay. it was. my mother being sick and dependent on oxygen for 3 years of me seeing her health declined that's what plagues me the most in my dreams and in my thoughts if i could erase that if that never happened i would feel better. oh i don't know i try to be grateful i'm alive and try to focus on my own objectives. and not dwell on the negative things of my memory. my girlfriend she's a very good vibe positive influence she wants me to be a better person. can you tell me about that. she's since i met her she's been trying to make me not be angry to make me not feel negative and to be a nurturing positives in like man so what she's asking for is something that's going to make me and prove therefore i must capitulate. how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep. it's very easy i sleep well sometimes i wake up when i have nightmares about my mother or something but i go back to sleep. that's unknown i don't know it just happens. i've been feeling good as the my reality is i've been hit with a lot of financial problems but i'm handling them well actually. i've been looking at it as my girlfriend is told me that i need to do this so therefore it is on the forefront of my mind right now. no. no. today when i woke up and it was a sunny beautiful day and i had a lot of goals to achieve and i'm achieving each one one by one it gives me a sense of accomplishment and happiness. my ideal weekend would be playing music with my girlfriend is that something we enjoy to do at going out to a nice dinner of healthy food and maybe exercising and feeling good with my body and mind and spirit. probably as a strong-willed person with a big heart but it has a short fuse and maybe complains about his own life too much. what are some. i wish i could not complain about negative things that happen and learn to roll with the punches and always look at the bright side. tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about. well one time i had a good friend tell me that one of the recordings i did he thought was horrible and i felt it was the best thing i've ever done so that and i would have don't understand how anybody could could feel that way and i didn't know if it was from jealousy or it was an honest evaluation so therefore i felt bad about that. as it's my goal. no nothing i regret. i felt. channel 20 years ago. i don't know. well everything i do i enjoy it's hard to pick out one exact event that i really enjoyed. i don't know how to put one above the other. when things don't go my way and finances come down and i don't get jobs at i go for that i am qualified for but i feel like i'm not getting my fair chance and opportunity. it's very frustrating. i don't really feel guilty about things sometimes maybe if i'm angry and i shouldn't be that i feel guilty about that i don't ever want to be short with my girlfriend ever she'll wouldn't it doesn't deserve somebody using vulgar language or shouting or something so i don't want to be that way around her so therefore that i am guilty. my achievements of my abilities to my music and my other abilities that i have and on my hard work has paid off and i'm very proud of those. okay thank you. goodbye. i like her can i have her in my house to talk to me everyday. i'm going to stop the recording so i have to say goodbye to him.,0,0,4,0.9480785,0.051921498,,,,,445

my gosh the sale of my business i wish i would have handled that differently i didn't have to really sell the business but i got scared and i sold it and i could have handled it in a much different way. fear. can you tell me about that. i was afraid of mounting debts i was afraid of. the economy wasn't good this 2007/2008 i was not thinking clearly i was afraid of mounting debts i was afraid of being sued by employees i was afraid of. yeah not having enough money i was afraid to be embarrassed i was. embarrassed you know for running out of money. yeah i would have handled that much different knowing what i know today. it was. yes i could have i could have downsized i could have. downsized sold cars got rid of cars i. could have cut hours i could have reduced my expenses and sat tight with it and not and just worked through it to not have reacted out of fear. when. i got my bachelor's degree in political science from ucla and i just finished a master's degree in education. my dream job.

she's my we're friends you know we do stuff together my sister she lives a half a block away from me my sister lives a block away from me she's got five kids and a husband and a family to contend with and my sister and i don't get to spend a lot of time together anymore she's got her life you know she's busy life the rest of my family is lives in belgium who i went to go see and some and that's all the family that i have i have an aunt that is very i'm a strange 2 and she lives in northern california and we never talk. because she. she ripped off the family estate my grandson my grandparents estate she she took all the money and all the stuff and and left her grandkids and her and mike you know and so her sister and my my grandmother's daughter and grandkids and great-grandkids got zero. and it was a few few few million dollars so we don't talk. i don't talk we don't talk. and it's sad. excuse me can you repeat that. wowed house if my father was a positive influence he was a really genuine man honest funny handsome i have a business owner a businessman that i work for who was it extremely positive influence at least in my professional life i've had a counselor at ucla who was totally i think of her. often and some of the little things that she said to me keep me going in my life now. trust the process. she told me to trust the process and when people are having trouble and i'm having trouble i take it step back and say you know just trust the process it it it all works out the way it's supposed to be. i'm just one more positive influence that i knew in hawaii that taught me. a friend of mine that lives on kawaii that taught me. how to enjoy nature and taught me how to fish and and i love her a lot too great positive influence healthy healthy influence. it's not. i have back problems so it's hard to sleep at night and i wake up in the middle of the night sort of. stretching and straightening out my back i have a back issue that sometimes more often than not. keeps me from sleeping good. that's okay i'm dealing with it. i'm a little depressed i've been a little depressed i haven't been working as much and. i you know i have pain in the mornings and in the evening i have pain throughout the day and night with my back and it's just a little depressing you know i get depressed all so you know just thinking about my business that i sold and you know where i would have been if i hadn't of done that and. a general feeling of. i've been a little depressed over the past couple of years actually. yes. well i've been diagnosed many many years ago and i guess depression stays with you although it gets treated and i was diagnosed about two years ago i think i don't know what to ask me that on the questionnaire as well and i sought treatment for it and then my insurance ran out and the prescriptions i couldn't put the do my prescriptions anymore but now i'm back on medication and so i take medication for my depression. therapy absolutely. i love therapy. wow that's huge confidence and self. confidence in myself confidence in my decision-making a general feeling of. overall content a sounding board you know when i have stuff that's bothering me that i can't go to the i feel that i can't go to the person with i can go to my therapist in. a lot of times the issue is resolved there it wasn't a big issue or i work through it or the therapist through the therapist allowed me to look at a different way of looking at the situation and in that way i find therapy to be invaluable actually. i believe so yes i was. i believe it was and he was told to me by a psychiatrist that that's what i was that's what i was having and this was within the last five years i think it was. looking back now. what are we 2013 it was 2009 so 4 years ago. i'm not able to deal with like shell shocked not able to deal with anything irritable on the phone i mean just just anything would get me to fly off the handle and i'm just not able just shell-shocked and not hiding it my in my house not opening mail not being able to concentrate not being able to deal with. with things that were that i felt were will that were bombarding me i felt overcome and the psychiatrist said that it was supposed to matter stress disorder butts and i was given some medication which i stayed on for a year or so or so and i don't know through psychiatry and therapist and medication i was able to come out of my shell a little bit. about a week ago i was on a hike and up in malibu and at this beautiful labrinth that looked over the pacific ocean and i was with a friend and we were having lunch. and i lay down in the grass and took a nap and i felt content i was happy at that moment at that moment that time a week ago. honest sincere. smart. caring. smart. good question. i'd have to think about that. yeah i have regrets in life and everything works out so you know if i could change the past i would have never dropped out of school when i did a long time ago i mean i've since gone back and completed lots of stuff i probably would have gone into the military i think i was going to do that in my early twenties i'm 55 now i sort of regret not doing that at that time. i regret. selling my business. i regret. of course i can't control this but i regret that my father died when i was so young and. he never really got to know me and i never really got to know him. i regret. i regret not seeing. my grandmother enough before she passed away. i regret. i mean those are the things that i can think of right now not putting away for retirement i regret when i had the money to do it. yeah i mean just here that's what i would say. stick with it. just stick with it because in order to get out you have to go through and. i when it comes to fear or flight i get the fear and i flight so sometimes you just have to sit in fear and then. everything works out. wow. i'm most proud that i have remained. genuine i'm most proud of. being who i am and being basically comfortable with that and i'm proud of that i haven't changed. to the warp to the world you know for the world i haven't changed i've stayed. who i am. thank you. thank you. bye.,0,0,4,0.92360103,0.076399006,,,,,450
31,111,yes i am. i'm doing very good today. i'm originally from chicago illinois moved out here when i was three. yes. i never go back. family issues. it depends on what you're into if you're into. the fast life and hollywood it doesn't compare at all if you're into the cold weather than you would rather be out there i like the sun. my mom and my dad split up. it's okay. i have no idea i was only three when i moved out here. i like the sunshine i like the weather i like the balance of the weather we have in the spring winter. fall and end in the summer i like the beaches i like hollywood i like that the lakers are here and i love the people is is a different variety i think la is a microcosm of the united states people from all over the world come to the united states and people from all over the country and all over the world they come to la for a better opportunity so that's why i like about la. no gang violence. no not really i travel one time to arizona and one time the stockton california and another time to barstow california but i don't do much traveling right now because of finances. study alcohol and drug counseling. i just filled it in my i just got into my heart that that's who i was supposed to be doing with my life is helping people overcome their addiction so. that was kind of easy choice i got some advice from people and i just went into it to do it just just to see what it was and finish school. it internship and got hired and so. i believe that's what i'm supposed to be doing with my life. i'm not working right now i actually moved away and. i had to. i was married and we had to move away we moved away because rent was cheaper so i actually had to give up that job in order to make that move but since i came back down i've been filling out applications and sending resumes and trying to get interview so i can get back into counseling. well. it can be it can be very difficult at times because. i have a felony and and so i can't work with you and i can work with the elderly and but the regular dose i can and then you have to be certified and i'm not certified yet you have to work a certain amount of hours in order to be certified before they even like you to take the test you after work a certain amount of hours so right now i'm just trying to get into interns you know try to intern and show people what i can do as a counselor because everything about me is not seen them my resume and. yeah they just want people to be certified not being certified the experience and the fact that i have a felony makes it hard. and my dream job is to open my own facility. or as an author. you know that the that depends on on on people mainly i mainly adapt my personality to the people that i'm around if people are perky that i'm going to be perky if they're standoffish then i may seem shy but i'm not sure i'm just giving them their space and allowing them to decide when they want to open up but if people open up right away then i open up right away. i mean listen to music or. i watch youtube write poetry. i'll just close my eyes and just lay down and pretend like i could sing which i can't so that's. and nothing i do is i eat ice cream. controlling my temper i'm very very good at it it depends on what it is i have to say that last time i lost my temper because i felt like somebody was. scaring my mother so i lost my temper but ninety-nine times out of hundred. i don't lose my temper don't like to raise my voice and i just like to be calm and cool and i like everybody to be comfortable i don't want anybody be frightened or anything there's no reason for anybody be frightened and for us to be angry and you know taking out our past frustrations out on people who had nothing to do with it i just believe that and i believe angry outbursts to be a link to. heart problems and high blood pressure so i definitely don't want that. well i was just telling you about it was it was my mother's husband and. tell you the truth i could have handled that differently but when i seen the look in my momma's eyes of fear i just lost it and i snapped you know i told my mother like i don't like this you need to take care of this because i'm don't know how long i can keep my composure as far as this cuz i've been seeing this guy mistreat my mother mistreat my mother but that's her husband and so i kept my distance in a relationship but when i saw her having fear in her eyes that triggered a part of me. dad. i don't like very much because i know if i get angry i usually stay angry for a long time so i should have just left. i should have just left and went home and rested and got up the next morning with the church but yeah we had a big time explosion and they had created and that created a lot of damage for about six to nine months so yeah those 6 9 months i can't get back. yes. well my brother in prison i haven't seen him in 20 years he's been there 20 years my sister move to chicago. 13 years ago i haven't seen her since then so i'm only close to my mother and my son i haven't seen him in 5 years and i'm still looking for him and waiting for the day i see him again and how that's going to turn out for me i just you know i have small family and. i have family in chicago but. i don't mess around with that side of the family just just because of what i seen and heard so i just don't want it to happen to me at all so i just keep my distance. has been a positive influence in my life i would say. taught me how to get my temper under control and how to express my emotions without me expressing my emotions being threatening to someone else and talked taught me how how to like monitor my emotions in monitor my thoughts and how strong my thoughts are and when they're really strong that's when i just need to be quiet until that intense spelling subsides and then i can speak rationally and not just emotionally and of course he's he was the one that told me that i should look into being a drug and alcohol counselor he's got 27 years clean and sober right now he used to live on skid row and the way he changed his life around and you know the way he approached me as a father was just something that i'll never forget. feel guilty about my grandfather. pass away in 2004. and at that time i was just getting out of prison. 2002 i was just getting out of prison and he came to see me and he. told me in so many words that he wasn't going to be around for that much longer but i didn't get it cuz i had a lot of drugs and alcohol my life at the time and my life is crowded with things that i consider to be more important than that plus the fact i didn't understand him what he was saying but. when he died. i figured out that he was telling me that i should probably spend more time with him before it's time for him to go but i couldn't see it then and. i feel. i think about it all the time. erased from my memory. will be the date. my brother hit my mom i always replay that over and over and over and over in my mind and it's like. that's what memories i can just go without replaying my mind over and over and over and over and over again so yeah that day that memory right there. i feel conflicting feelings. because i want hand. on way hey my brother was protecting me. from getting beat. and on the other hand he was his my mom. so. time in the middle. most nights i don't know. i go to sleep maybe 3 in the morning and i'm proud i'm more than likely up at 7 in the morning so i don't get much sleep. it depends it depends on the environment i mean if i don't sleep well. i'm going eventually i'm going to be here to boo but doesn't happen right away it depends on my environment and who's around me if they're difficult people that's going to be a challenge for me and if people are easy going and no one would even know that i didn't get much sleep. i've been feeling lately i just been feeling like. dad. things are about to start going better for me maybe some better decisions taken advantage of the opportunities that come to me taking advantage of my talents taking advantage of meeting the right people that can open the right doors for me so i'm very enthusiastic about that even if it doesn't happen i'll send out a million resumes i don't care if i get 5 interviews i've i've never stopped because i know know that been a counselor is my life mission and and i'm also destined to be a writer and it's just a matter of time before my book is out there and people know about me because i found a lot of time to study human behavior and things like that and i have a lot to offer humanity so it's just a matter of time before. that the public is exposed to what i've been gathering. my behavior i'm more mellow i laughed more more humorous. i let a lot of things go that i used to just. let take me off and anger me and things that i can't control like trying to control people or or or trying to make sure people don't betray me and you just can't control that i think i matured mentally and psychologically and and the acquisition of a sense of humor was a major major breakthrough for me so. i know my thoughts of change and with my thoughts changing my behavior has changed i still have to monitor it my thoughts and my behavior i still have to monitor them but overall you know. back then i just tolerating myself now i. actually like myself and it will boo boo hoo you to feel the same way. no no i haven't. no. last time i feel happy was last night cuz the lakers won the basketball game. my best friend was described me he calls me the truth. because i always tell the truth and people tried to hide stuff and i always refill it they can't hide it from me i have a statement that says i see through you like a clear glass with nothing in it and i see stuff days and months before they start happening i no human behavior when i see it and i sniff it out real well and it's just a gift that was given to me so he calls me the truth because of how i interact with people and how people have to come clean with me because when they look at me they know that i see through them like i said like a clear glass with nothing in it and yes that's why he calls me the truth. i wish i would have never. well obviously i wish i would have never went to prison. i wish. falcon change well. my economic status my employment status. my teeth that's like a problem area for me i did a lot of stupid things years ago and it caught up with me and i didn't take care of my teeth and now that i need to be. confident about myself as i can be you know it always comes up every now and then you know the thought like i wonder if they look when they're to look in that might if i never get the i never get the impression that they are but in the back of my mind there she starts that says. are they looking at my teeth so i will really change that and i will change my physical size i think i would like to be at least 35 pounds heavier but i'm working on it. 20 years ago which would make me 18. i would have at that time i was a big-time high school basketball player for fremont high school and i had college is coming to see me and i would have given myself the opportunity was the to stay away from the troublemakers because i didn't and i blew my opportunity to play college basketball for duke blue devils and who knows i could have been playing for the lakers last night but hey. i'm most proud of the fact that. you know what i'm most proud of my mom. really. really she graduated from school. she got a full-time job she got a full-time job she would wake up at. 5 in the morning go to work get off her job at 3:30 go straight to the college lead to college at 9 at night she does this 5 days a week and still had the strength to maintain of she was on the dean's list and president's list so doing all of this you know when they say that older people can do things i just think that's dispels that rumor. and she recently got her license as a evangelist in the church so i'm just real proud of that and. her life is been affecting people in a positive way so yeah mama. okay thank you. goodbye. okay. oh did you know that she stopped. oh okay okay.,0,0,4,0.9479959,0.05200409,,,,,434
32,114,i look like a cancer patient. okay so now i'm going to. yes. i'm good. iowa. when are y. 2001. holidays and special family events. it's much better there. and i e i got into ucla went to ucla for three years. in the screenwriting program. it took a long time it was difficult. just the. getting used to and managing the stress of everyday living. variety of right here like that. dallas traffic. internationally no. just haven't had reason to i guess. i have a bs in math and physics. i went to school later in life and i wanted to actually know something. so it was very difficult very difficult but i did it why. fascinated me i didn't want to be intimidated by it. oh yeah. to be employed writer. stream lee difficult extremely difficult writing any type of fictional fiction ride is extremely difficult i worked as hard as i do now when i was in school i have a phd in math and physics. it's so hard. outgoing. at the present circumstance it's it's not a catch all depends on the the moment. what i do to relax i swim. swam one last friday. friday. what do i do when i am annoyed. swear to myself. pretty good pretty good takes a lot to get me to express anger. but i do. it was in traffic actually. that was probably two weeks ago in traffic. sure. i'm just waiting for the lights and some kind of pickups honking at me and like why humpback so he didn't like that he pulled up alongside me i had to have no idea what his problem was and we had a few words. i mean i have no idea what i was doing wrong. swipe the light. guilty that's a strong word. if i feel guilty as i feel remorseful about actions or words. said and done in the past they come up. oh just passed in interpersonal reactions with friends are family you know it'll just hit you one day you're not necessarily thinking about it for whatever reason and just out of the blue it hits you my all why they say that what i do that. situation. got a blank. for me that question has a negative connotation. so something that's possibly negative in my recent past. what would have done differently. i don't. i'm pretty in control of my emotions and taking the temperature of the moment and responding my when to respond when and when not to respond. so nothing really springs to mind that i wish i'd done differently recently in my pass pass yes but not recently. oh. swallowing my pride. putting my tail between my legs. and saying i was wrong to friends. i contacted him again and then we're fast friends again. now this is again this is past past so not recent past so. probably. altercations i've had with my mom. and i know things i've said to hurt her. i know. yeah when you. hurt the ones that are closest to you that sticks. so any time any one of those situations you know. so when i think my emotional iq has. ground so i think in the past passed my emotional cues was stuck on infant so. so. i have a good relationship with my mother and both my sisters and their families my father never had a good relationship don't know if that will be possibly still alive but he's advanced alzheimer's so he's mad at everybody right now i was fine it was slow. psalm 100. impossible foods my life. my sister's to talk with my sisters. extremely easy asleep while it's night anywhere from at least 8 to 10 hours a night. oh star jake. just going through the motions you know like this i like this david lynch who is not necessarily mainstream he's done some crazy stuff are his movies and tvs concerned he said the idea of the tanks driven artist is bs because you want to be creative get a good night sleep i like that. good i can't wait to get up and start the day. oh if if that happens it's gradual i'm always thinking about my behavior and my thought processes and how to be more productive in my life. with what. pme me now i don't know i haven't been taking diagnosed with any psychological. acronym. no. this weekend had a good good time with friends with great was with friends and we just were able to talk about you know some things and conversation lasted two and a half hour 3 hours to inspect it to happen was good i like talking with smart people informed people open-minded people it was a great those types of discussions are rare. almost like how you get after running or exercising you know the endorphins it was the same thing. i am. add with friends or working on my stuff my writing. for exercising. my heights i wish i were taller. i wish. color of the physicality i wish i didn't wear glasses. nothing internal. i'm patience i've been commended for my patience by strangers. my relationships with my friends and my family i understand that it takes time and energy to maintain them and i take that time and energy. well it's a really open general question of course now goes back are you talkin recently are you talkin in the path. i always regret. i regret. the whole thing's not a big thing not being more productive or efficient in the use of my time each day. i hate wasting time i hate wasting money i hate wasting energy. that's a deep question. i'd say. i was co-dependent 10 or 20 years ago i said get some help. get some help. you got your coat. sure. i just

33,118,so you guys are controlling the virtual human okay. yes. i'm doing fine thank you. i'm from los angeles california yes. i love man saying i like the weather i like the lifestyle i like the variety of beach know we have it all. things i don't like about la the rent is way way way way too expensive it's ridiculous. i'm sure you can tell by my shoes. i have i'm well-travelled. nice. enjoy.. i enjoy seeing new places going new places it's different every where the people are different. it's fun. okay well the most recent is last year i went to family reunions in new orleans so that was in june and while i was there we also visited slidell louisiana for the the swamp tours and vicksburg mississippi where my mom is from and we spent the night in ferriday louisiana with my aunt to will be 101 this year in may. there's a lot as far as traveling or just.. most memorable experience and well i don't know if it's just one probably when. i used to travel with my dad that's where i got a lot of my traveling from. can you tell me about. yeah it was best car sometimes planes mostly white just i guess i'll say mostly down south but it was really fun especially the road trips. just a general and also drama. what's your dream job. my dream job is to become a real estate investor. well i've sort of really been into it every since 2005 i just don't have the capital right now or the connections but since i do like real estate i'm just going to start off as a real estate agent so i should have my license sometime this year. outgoing. i'm well i'm not sure why it could be a little bit of both but i'm pretty outgoing. well speaking of hawaii i did live there for a year and a half but what do i do to relax is either i'm usually take a nap take a bath. or just try to get things off of my mind and try to spend my energy in more positive ways. it needs to be worked on but i know when to control it when i need to. well me and my ex-husband still get into arguments is this just over a text message but i'm actually it was my fault but usually it's his but it just starts little and kind of snowballs out of control butt. that's usually how it goes. well i don't know what else to do except for pray on it because i thought once i moved into another house it would be over but i see that we're still getting into it so i don't know maybe ignore it or if he wants to be right than them be right i guess. probably quite a few things but i don't regret anything i've done in my life but. situation i wish i would have handled differently just. kind of everything in my life almost i could have done it differently or i would if i had the chance but i'm not worried about it cuz i don't regret anything that i've done in my life. tell me about. the hardest decision probably when i had to get a divorce that that may have been the hardest a one of the hardest decisions. it was just a lot of a lot of stuff through the years the relationship is kind of deteriorated the relationship between us was still good then the things that he were doing i would have been able to overlook it a little bit more because i would feel like well our relationship is good and it's difficult to find a really really good relationship but since our relationship deteriorated and there's just a lot of disagreement and arguing and problems financial problems and he's doing this so i. i just decided just forget it i mean i tried but you know he didn't want to cooperate so. well i'm happy with what's going on now i mean i wish that we could still be a family but since that's not going to happen yes i am happy with my life right now yes. something i can erase. i don't think i really need to erase anyting i finally got an over the way the kids treated me at school but other than that i can't think of anything to erase. it's fair / good there is no problems right now so i guess i'll just say good yeah there's no problem. well i would have to say my mother yes. i'm with she's just always supported me and everything that i've done whether it's good or not so good so i think that's a blessing. sometime sometime it's not. well i just don't get enough hours of sleep i guess that's what it is cuz i would like to sometimes so that's more the problem i would like to get. i'm just sleepy yeah sleepy tired feeling like i want to go take a nap. i've been feeling fine. i know they've been about the same. have you ever been. no. no. i'm really happy probably last week because i got over to a little bit of money so. well i guess my best friend will be my mom or maybe my entertainment friend that i've been knowing since 96 i really wouldn't i'm not going to say i don't consider him a best friend that we don't really hang out that much but he is very ungenerous to me and my mom. so. well right now i spend my weekends doing chores and classwork and sleeping in. but maybe after the class work is out of the way maybe i could do something else. myself well i do wish that at times i could control my temper a little more and of course i would like to lose weight be a little bit more active and i wish my skin would clear up. it was probably when i was in school school years or terrible for a lot of people because the kids are animals so they try to make you feel like you're nothing like your piece of turd on to their foot so that's probably the last time is an adult now. i would say that i'm genuine i'm honest i'm supportive. and i'm just a good friend. no. did you give yourself. well 20 years ago just because you're pregnant that doesn't mean that you're eating for two and you can eat loads of food like people tell you that's the main thing i'm i'm going to tell my daughter's no i'm just eat as you normally eat the eat more healthier there's no need to gain 80 lb when the baby is just 20 pounds or less and you have all this weight to lose also know if i came into any money now 20 years ago i was probably just thinking about shopping or just kind of spending it on frivolous stuff where is now i would invest it. so yeah i think that's about it. proud of. i guess maybe myself my kids. hey thank you. bye.,0,0,4,0.9401997,0.05980038,,,,,458
34,121,alright cool. i'm doing good what about you. los angeles but i couldn't even recited inglewood. we did i answer your question i don't know. okay. la the murals the ocean what else the people my family is over here so that's the best part. what about you. i would say the smog yeah the air had to be cleaner and yeah. that's what i mean is good people bad people too but yeah for the most part it's all good. yeah i've been in mexico and the temples and it was in california so yes. traveling like tina are that's good healthy for the body cleaner blood flow the people culture and stories and then come back you share stories with like your friends. yeah anytime like right now or when. okay so i just one time i was a kid we went out to the temples and it started raining so we just start walking through in like when we get to the top one thing i didn't know before is that the higher you go does the smartest steps get so like people back then had on a smaller feet so what happened was as i went higher towards the temple i had to walk sideways so my feet can measure up to that the steps but once you get up there tonight to you. i am. general education but mainly art yeah i took a lot of art classes. well when i was a kid i scribble and walls with crayola so i figured you know like it kind of stuck around with me so i just posted it so yeah. my dream job would be to get paid for painting painting art. yeah. yeah pretty simple. it's not so much that it's hard it just requires passion persistence and faith and well you just have to really believe in yourself to yourself the more likely you are able to succeed. i consider myself to be shy and certain time of places but i am also outgoing when like i have the energy so i feel like it's well-balanced you know like i'm shy when it's i guess okay to be shy you know and i'm outgoing when like the need to actually have fun or just explore feels good like if i make sense but yeah. screensaver. yeah. 2 hour relax. either well i'm going to say this but i smoke weed so that helps and i like painting painting humans help me relax you know blue on relax me and also green when i use these two colors and make a painting account calms me down. i didn't have a blue shirt yeah. my temper well my thoughts and my thoughts control my emotions and my emotions yeah scream until my temporary getting mad or if i do get mad what will be the outcome you know so control my temper is just like training my thought. the last time i argued with somebody was with my with my father and it was because i wanted to eat food but he wanted me to buy wine so right when the food was ready i was hungry eating you like nope so that kind of frustrated me and the way i handled it was like well i could just eat when i come back and i'm doing him a favor so you know and then after you not to eat and eat in peace so yeah. my family is pretty good my mom and dad have a good relationship and still married and my brothers and sisters we help one another out so that's good it's just yeah it's a good team. a situation i wish i could handle differently would be. that's a good question i mean can i get scenario. okay. situation and kind of differently what you got something i feel like if i'm calm in any situation i could figure it out you know but if it came down to like a rubik's cube maybe how to handle the situation would be just buy a feeling i'm feeling making mistakes because i don't make the right mistakes and the right lessons will come after so that's the best way i could answer your question you know yeah. deposit influence pretty much anybody who told me the truth has been a positive influence influence you know like yeah even though it may hurt like all the truth does hurt well they're not trying to be mean that actually. good influences i was in my friends my mom and dad my brother my sister's yeah. we'll see that's the thing like i have i've had some pretty bad experiences with like being at gunpoint and with a knife but at the end of the day with that did was like give me more insight made me more aware and it taught me how to read people a little bit more like dispense things out and also how to avoid situations so even though it was bad and it did kind like scar me a different pair me for like the world you know because it's happened to me when i was like 12 13 years old so if everyday could be exposed to like you know like guns nice and all that stuff so it's it's bad but it's good in a long-term you know because if you get out of that slump it's like nothing else would really phase you because you think you might have been through worse so it's not as bad as you know and. so yeah. the hardest. this one right now i don't feel like answering when i got stuck i like kind of think i was part of it but hearts decision as far as like life-changing. life changing whether to continue school college or not i kind of chose. to like i went to school but i chose to pursue my own like. like i'm there any more advice can i give myself with people who are already in the field i want to be in so that was a hard choice because there was no guarantee that i would like run into like the right people but i took that chance you know i'm at the right people so. yeah. yeah yeah. how easy is it for you to get a good night. actually really easy i sometimes like i could sleep right now in like 10 minutes you know i just like like soda my air pattern. lately i've been feeling good i've been feeling like i have free will like at this point in time i feel like if i chose a path any path with like my heart i could get there you know but i'm kind of like still deciding if i carry sing in august pass or in the air or should i make my own i don't know that's why i'm at i feel like a free will. oh yeah. ladylike in the past 2 weeks or today. okay yeah you know like. yeah things happen that would change like my feelings and. example right now they just happened right now like. this experience for one is kind of like a shift in my thought because. yeah it's like it's technology you know it's like it's a trip to see how far i like one could take a thought and then make it reality so that's kind of like shifting my thoughts right now this experience this whole experience. yeah. post-traumatic stress disorder no. depression i know how it's like to be depressed but diagnosed by a doctor no. depression. how how it feels. how does depression feel like it feels like it's like a bird in the cage being depression is like being a fish who can't swim in the water have feeling depression is like being a bird without wings pretty much it feels like you're limited but then a thing is to get out of that depression if i get to awaken and change your perspective and focus on. like i would say colors colors help and people talking to people helps. yeah. being depressed. 16. i don't know like it could come like it to happen everyday like it's small doses doses so like i could say today you know earlier when i was just by myself i felt a little depressed then what happened i fixed it like a cut up a friend and met up with him and yeah. i mean at this moment i feel pretty happy you know i'm talking to average person is pretty cool and yeah right now if you're happy. sometimes hard headed like you would try to teach me a certain investment whether it's art or just like in my character and yeah he just described me as like like like listen by the same thing he'll still do what he wants to do but it's so pretty much like i don't know. yeah i mean that's what he tells me but your overall good person. i just exercised my diet food my food intake and yeah. health. i would say when i was like in middle school or in elementary little bit too but yeah it would be was it would either be about. will pumas my heart like something and i thought it was good and then someone else be like all you know that looks kind of like like trash and then i'll be like oh damn i could accept and be like yeah it does kind of look and then fix it or why would do back then we'll be like damn you know you're going to do well and i thought and then just like stay there for a bit and then eventually i'll come out of it but yeah you should use bone people's words. and ideas that yeah. yeah i said it. regret yeah i got a couple things i regret. like what well sometimes i feel like i should have completed the whole university thing but i mean at the same time i feel like if i really wanted to go i would have gone. so yeah that's kind of regret my head. 10 or 20 years ago would be on seek spiritual well-being you know learn how to handle your thoughts to your thoughts i will teach myself pick the people you surround yourself with because that definitely has a major influence in your environment street events you experience and as far as your overall happiness. yeah. among other things but yeah. i'm most proud of right now is my paintings i'm proud of that because like i feel like depends on releasing are things that no one else could duplicate you know it's like it's one of a kind of nikes is there you know is sazon signature something so yeah i'm pretty happy about that. yeah thank you. are you thinking. alright bye. yeah.,0,0,4,0.90649533,0.093504645,,,,,464
35,138,virtual human she's in chat with you for a bit okay. okay. okay. are you okay. yes. how do i find thank you. originally i'm from well i was born in mississippi so i'm from gulfport mississippi. yes. i didn't have a choice i was a child i moved here with my parents. when i was 2 years old. if i was i was a toddler. yeah if i like to travel and i travel a lot. being around new environments and new people different things. well one of my favorite trips was visiting africa and i think 2006 i visited west africa that was a great trip for me it was a medical mission where we volunteered and give medical assistance to people. a friend of mine was actually involved and she talked to me about getting involved so i went with her and it went from there so i don't know i made the decision that way. i am i am happy i did that it's something i'll never forget. i studied english and education so that i could teach high school students. not currently no. well right now i tutor privately for private tutoring company and looking to get back into the classroom working as a teacher. wow anything that combines teaching traveling and writing would be a dream job for me so tell anything i can buy and sell those three items so teaching has the closest i've come to that. okay. occasionally f. i don't know i guess in comparison to others that are considered outgoing and and a lot of people have said i seem reserved our kind of introverted i don't know. well. i don't know i read them i just started meditation. try to breathe and calm down. things that make me really mad. mistreatment of children. abusive children. try to figure out what's annoying me usually and then go from there if i can control not being annoyed by ultimately i control that whether or not i'm annoyed so try to figure out what the problem is and then go from there and not being if i can help it at all. no i'm fine. control tank at controlling my temper i think so i don't have. the last time i argue with someone. i was. i don't know maybe a couple of days ago and it was about. it was about a smell they had on their clothes but i thought it smelled like perfume and they said and did not. of course i think i'm very close to my family we're pretty close-knit family talk everyday see each other most everyday. there been a lot of positive influences in my life i would say my aunt and definitely my mother have all been positive influences. more about that. well i look look up to my eye i think she's positive i look up to her because obviously we grew up with very similar backgrounds came from very similar neighborhoods and area is and she's very successful despite the types of things that we've gone through as children and she doesn't let her pass to find her future my mom's overcome so many obstacles as well and she has some challenges with her health but she still tries to be optimistic and she still tries to. no overcome these things and just still live our life despite some physical barriers that she might have so i look up to people who are able to know not allow their current situation to dictate their future because anything is possible. military no i have not. no. i have. well i was diagnosed with in the last year and then again most recently within the last 3 months. well fear and just not knowing what to do with some of the things i was feeling and not knowing. you know why i couldn't stop feeling the way i was feeling. there were a lot of symptoms on. you know mostly i gained a lot of weight i couldn't sleep a lot and then sometimes i could sleep too much. so sad sometimes. like i want to cry a lot. feeling okay i'm more days you have i don't know every day is different so i mean today i feel fine but like i said everything's differently and lately i've been feeling more like i command them involved in my own life and like i want to get. thousand do more things. no no no not any different from before what i was experiencing before. no. well i was receiving. i got a psychotherapy and i don't know a lot of things happened i moved for a while to go take care of my grandmother and i just kind of got more involved in taking care of other people instead of myself for a while. but sometimes. i do yes it is. it's kind of difficult i either have a hard time falling asleep or hard time staying asleep. i'm sure it is i just don't know what it is as of yet because i usually had some thoughts continue with thoughts running through my mind. either keep me up or make it hard for me to go to sleep or i'll make it hard for you to stay asleep. journal sometimes that might help if i can write something down and get it out that helps. other than that i don't know haven't found any really great way to coping. tire. mostly tired. kind of confused. i don't know for the most part i feel happy it's just i'm. last time i felt really happy was i guess over the holidays. i'd love to hear all about it. i don't know i guess just being around family and friends just the holiday season i guess in general that's just a happy time for me and some people i haven't seen in awhile. talk about it. call my best friend describe me probably as. quiet sometimes cautious talkative sometimes tenacious i don't know a lot of my friends say that they look up to me for some of my accomplishments and they also say that they are grateful to have me as a friend because i'm caring and compassionate are easy to talk to. that i might him over so i can sister to them. everyone has regrets i'm sure yeah i guess so. to just. relax and be yourself and just go ahead and it sounds cliche and i don't mean to sound that way but it's true is just we have to learn how to be comfortable with you and relax and just know you i'm to not compare yourself to other people because what someone else is doing or where they may be in their life at a certain time is not necessarily where you are supposed to be or what you're supposed to be doing at that time it doesn't mean that you're less competent or less able to do it it just means that everyone has their path and everyone has their their time and their progression to how they get two things so i would tell me 10 years ago to just believe in me and stay on my own path for what it is that i want from my life and don't be. i'm really enjoyed working with okay that's fine project with my younger relatives my cousin's we did a science project together and that was fun despite the mess we made those ball. being the first to attend college in my family and then i'm going to college and coming

37,157,and i'm going to pull her up and if you let me know if you can see her just fine without your glasses. you know i bet it i think from this distant i think i better. okay. are you okay. yes. okay. come here from from alhambra. the weather is really nice and everything is very familiar. sometimes there's too much congestion on the roads to too much traffic. hi i studied art and photography. i am it was so much his decision i just kept noticing that i was very interested in it. are you still working in that yes. i'm a photographer. oh i suppose.. running a family portrait studio or some other type of photography business. i know not know i'm in it also an apartment manager keeps me tied down. it's a fair it's not the greatest because of being a department manager i do have free rent but i have to stay. they're a lot so. that part does the refrigerant part is very good. oh gosh. a most memorable experience. it's hard to say. well. i mean there's good and bad memorable experiences. oh well i guess i'm like sports success when i was in high school and a few other things that i was happy about and some art pieces i've made were memorable and. some bad things would be my father's stats right now but those are very memorable not good though. call my parents and have a lot of brothers and sisters so my family. are you to your family. a fairly close the most of them live around at la. i just a few that are from. distant my brother lives in new york and. my other brother lives in maui. how mostly very talented. just stem more involved in technology then maybe i was or i am and they are. i think they're more of a hive mind and when i grow up sims like they were all hooked into social media. hi is going to walk or watch television. carplay with my computer. and i. well. there's some. there's some kind of. injustice has that happening not big deals but for example our parking situation got worse with some new district parking text kind of upsetting and this city doesn't seem to anna. i make any exceptions or change the rules. and also some unfair things at work sometimes happened that are. got that are upsetting. oh yeah i work in at a high sky worked at a high school dance this last weekend and when we arrived at this site. the people at the site said we couldn't set up all of our equipment and backdrops and things at the location where we were assigned to do it and we had to go outside. and then to get in okay to go inside because being outside we weren't prepared for nor told in advance that we were to be outside it delayed our set-up time and that does wouldn't have bothered me except that on monday morning the school called our boss and complained that we were late setting up when it when they told us to wait for them and we told them we would be delayed if we wait until we still get a complaint so that that part is upsetting in. and our work doesn't back us up at the at the office they just need to place the school to maintain the account so often when that something like that happens that means they will not send you out to work at that school again which which translated to less payroll hours for the photographers that were on that job. that's how that's how they do things. so that that is upsetting. most of the time that dust off my resume and start looking for other situation setter yeah. a pretty good are you sure that you might die in the moment i don't really lose it but later i might prevent or something like that went on the on the location i wouldn't do that. well just today we have a tight schedule today and i have a friend that i'm sharing a car with today and we. we were arguing where to go first. 10 time so we compromised and did most of her things in one of my things then after this was one of the things this over then we're going to do some of her things. no. post-traumatic stress syndrome is that what that is. no. yes. what's a 1980. yeah i think believe it was 1980 yeah. my father noticed some symptoms my father's is just passed away but it was the psychiatrist. well i wasn't sleeping i was laying around the house. miss waking up at. noon sunday and i didn't have a focusrite for getting a job it wasn't clear enough i remember some job interviews that i've go to their front door and then i wouldn't go in and i think that was all i'll part of depression. yeah i thought i had a problem but i didn't know what it was. no. well and i went for three years and then the psychiatrist said that you thought that i was done it but in it and i i did get too much better place i have to watch all the time to see what's going on with depression so i think i'll have good days and bad days. i think therapy makes you see what the. like that i thought of it as a filter or wearing a as if you were put on a depression pair of sunglasses you don't really you see everything through that so you have to i have to sort of try to take the glasses off for a little bit and double-check and my really receiving these things accurately. or am i seeing it through with a depressed few point when i try to look for clues about that. i think i am. slipping back a little bit. i don't do well during unemployed. i've noticed in my path in my past and right now we have a work slowdown so it's easy to slip back into sleeping too late or putting things off because the schedules too wide open for for me for me personally as a depressed person i think that structure is really important to get you out of bed and you have to get somewhere in time and deal interact with people and those are all beneficial things for someone who tends to be depressed. well i don't know if it changes its a little bit i said to be focused on some things that are probably not that uplifting lightsaber but it's more negative like i. i've been sort of thinking about how soldiers in the past i don't know why but like the end during the roman era or the ancient greeks how it would have been like to be in the in a frontline battle with just kind of in my opinion crude weapons and no medical help and. i don't know i set my mind seems to go there a lot i'm just thinking about that and i've been looking at it and reading books about that or video clips on youtube. and things like that or some other kind of like terrible doom type things like i was watching on that animal show like crocodile attacks and things like that. we're probably shouldn't dwell so much on that. i am in life in general yeah well. i think i regret not finishing college i think i had a i think i was going into depression right then it wasn't coping in my senior year very well and didn't really i didn't get out of college with a degree although i was there seven years but so that's very that's a big regret that i have. i think it would have been to. at certain points i probably should have sought therapy and also probably some outside help just with getting through finals just the logistics i had i had was an art major and i had no car so. a lot of the art projects and things were difficult to move back and forth in and also to meet at away locations i think it probably would have been worth it to. do whatever it took to get a car at that time. so. well i'm ivan tell them very patient and also i have some original original artistic ideas so. those are those are good qualities i'm very loyal and and also. and i support my friends fairly generous with them so. it's a. i said i really enjoyed it was i had a. i had a nice experience. just photographing out a soccer game recently. that really enjoyed that so. okay. it's my pleasure thank you goodbye. i'll head to bed. let's write interesting.,1,1,4,0.19573729,0.8042627,,,,,356
38,182,okay. sure. i'm well thank you. southern california. the weather the mountains the ocean. traffic. air quality. no not a lot. time money. i studied art. studio art. it was just always a a talent and a desire i had from childhood. i am. making a good living through my art. it's challenging. well. i need it's about having the time. and finding a niche that appeals to others while being able to do work that stays true to my own vision. somewhere between. i read. i walk dogs. i spend time with my family. so it's very good i love my family very much and they love me very much we were very supportive of each other. i'm pretty good most of the time i'm not so great when i'm dealing with a lot of rush hour traffic. but it's not out of control. i don't really remember i want to say it was probably my daughter and it was probably about something stupid little stupid thing. my daughter is 39. beautiful brilliant very talented very goal-driven my son is 27 he is more laid-back very sweet and he's. starting to. be a little more goal-driven a little less satisfied with just the daily grind. being a parent is some. very challenging in a wonderful way. i think the hardest thing is is fear and worry for your children today's world can be very. violent and scary and you fear for your children safety and well-being. i'm sorry. oh gosh. sprint at the close friendship you have with your children the. the love the support the joy of just everything little things that you share. oh. well i'm i. talk to my children about anything and everything we have very open communication which in my parents generation i think children were more seen and not heard. well with my daughter my first child i was young and inexperienced not only in being a mother but naive in a lot of ways regarding life in general and i think probably most parents have regrets of situations they may have had their children when they were when they were young that weren't the best. sometimes i feel that i should have. ben. more aware at a younger age. just just. decisions in situations that decision to make situations you find yourself and when you're younger out of being naive and and. i even though logically i know that it's something that couldn't be avoided at the time you know as you get older you hindsight is 20/20 is she could older you you look back and wish that you had have been more on top of your you're. your life when you were younger. oh gosh. i honestly can't think of anything. i don't know if that i would want i can take him in advance i don't know that i would want to erase it from my memory because. i feel that we learn from everything and that there's i don't want to lose the lesson that i'm to learn from that experience. positive influence in my life my daughter my son my granddaughter. there's only enough an author carlos castaneda. just stopped my my family has been a positive influence because of their love and support and in reading carlos castaneda's works i find that he. has a brilliant mind and because i've practice some of what he talks about in his books and experience them as being authentic. where is some people. you know question has validity i found it he has something very extraordinary to offer mankind. pretty easy fall asleep pretty quick. no not really just always looking for the next two. projekt202. get started on. no. no. yesterday yesterday was mother's day and my children gave me flowers and beautiful gifts and made me a wonderful brunch and we spent the day together and it was very very nice. oh. is it going. easy to be around. friendly happy. i would like to work on being more focused on on projects. gosh. probably when i was a kid you know kids can be. kids can be cruel to each other so nothing that. i still at this age. take personally or are you know hold a grudge for. sure everybody has regrets but you do the best you can do at the time and you learn and you move on. i don't know why i can't answer that one. oh gosh. i read a great book the last couple days and i've been working on a new painting that i'm really pleased with this i like the way it's going. my kids. but the fact that my kids are are. wonderful human beings i feel very blessed. goodbye. well that was interesting. should i take these off.,0,0,4,0.9525707,0.047429297,,,,,472
39,194,essential let you know and then you can let me know okay thanks. thanks. go ahead and move his cord behind you didn't get any way. hi hello. are you okay with this. yes. okay not too bad. i'm from chicago south side. i'm back in 1978 when i was 18. lately not much maybe once every two or three years. compared to the letter a. it's totally different you know horrible weather and. it's just a whole different atmosphere. let's see my mother had moved to africa. i graduated from high school and i had a friend down here so i just thought well let me try la. very easy actually yeah i loved it from the moment i got off the airplane. number one the weather son is very important to me so i love the weather. i don't know just kind of a more laid-back atmosphere variety. of people. and now it's my my homebase you know my friends that are family. that's how i like my family is here now. i guess the small hug earthquakes. traffic. just basic things like that really. i don't currently but i did throughout my life i travel quite a lot. i just seeing seeing other cultures and seeing more history and meeting people and. just fun at the fun of it as well. let's see what one trip i went to england. ireland and scotland and france all in you know one trip. so that was a nice variety. i guess you could say probably skiing in val de saire france. that was fun i'm glad i got to do that. that's great. do you consider yourself more shy. i'm kind of shy by nature i've tried to grow out of being shy so i'm not fully shy but i was always an extremely shy child. but now here in culver city this is my environment and i i guess you could say i'm not really shy and in my hometown of culver city. i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got. to relax i like to just curl up in my bed and read my book take a nap watch tv sometimes on the couch in the living room just you know stay at home and kind of vegetate. pretty good yeah my tempers pretty level. probably with my husband. and. i can't remember the moment what it was about. okay. tell me about your relationship with you. well when you say my family do you mean. my family from childhood or my current family. okay well i guess my current family comes to mind i have two daughters and my relationships pretty good it's okay with them but they're teenagers which you know going they're going through a lot of hormones and they can be kind of bitchy and. and but i have hope that you know they'll grow out of bed and soon someday we'll have a really good relationship. and then there's the husband which. like i guess i could face soon-to-be-ex-husband hopefully soon we need to get a divorce but we're still together due to financial reasons. and yeah yeah so that that's not good relationship with the husband but. but since we have determined that we need to divorce. we don't expect anything out of each other so we don't argue as much so that's good. well. i guess our marriage. i wish i had noticed early on that. you know it was like way off from what i thought it was. how do you say oh my god. hardest decision. i guess leaving my first husband that was pretty hard. well you know we were married and i wasn't content i guess you could say and. i kind of just gave up on our relationship and now that i look back i think it's because. i want children and he would have been happy to never have any and so since i didn't have a father it was very important that i create children with someone who really wanted to be a father and so i was kind of at an age where i needed to start thinking about having children yet i was with someone who really was not into it so that i think that's one maybe the core reason why i was not content and i just felt like this marriage isn't going to work n so you know we went to therapy and everything and he did not want to break up and. and i had to leave him because i just wasn't happy and that was that was very hard cuz. yeah. felt like i was hurting him which which i was him he survived he got over and now he's married with two kids but it was hard to leave him. tell me about nevada or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. something i wish i could erase from my memory have to think about that. i'm sure there's something well. yeah there's some. i guess it'd be nice to erase from my memory a recent i'm not resend but an event in my. recent adulthood here in culver city where one of my best friends. betrayed me by back years ago when my husband first got into real estate she and her family were growing and they really need a larger home and. we just assumed that you know that they would use my husband as their agent supposed to sell their current home current at the time and purchase a new home. and as it turned out they surprised us and had been talking to this other local agent and yeah that was devastating. i don't think i've ever been betrayed like that so i wish i could erase that not cuz now you know this was back when the kids were really young. and. my daughter at the time my youngest daughter was let's say. 6 maybe. maybe five anyway her and my best friend's daughter are the same age they were born within days of each other we were pregnant together and they were really tight those two little girls and they ended up not going to the same elementary school so they didn't get to hang out during those years but every time we run into them in the neighborhood are they run into each other at a summer camp or something they were just so connected they were just you know like two peas in a pod even those her their moms weren't talking to each other anymore so now they're 13 and 14 and they're in middle school together and they're still very connected in fact she she for the first time spent the night at our house last night with my daughter and another girl and it's just a little awkward you know cuz now these girls are becoming really good friends. your friends and yet i still have this. bad memory of what her. her mom did to to me. that was about 1:10. about 8 years ago. i tried it i try to ignore it and put it out of my head which have been able to. in recent years. but obviously it still comes up. anyway that was that. not that easy i do sometimes get a decent night's sleep but sometimes it's hard to get to sleep and most of the time i wake up and can't get back to sleep but or i finally get back to sleep and then it's almost time to get up you know that that difficult thing. well the waking up in the middle of the night is definitely triggered by having to go to the bathroom and then. you know it's not always that easy to get back to sleep and then i wake up again to go to the bathroom. so i guess that's the trigger as far as getting to sleep having a hard time there i don't know i think there's just too much on my mind running through my mind and the day i feel like i haven't accomplished enough during the day so. it's hard for me to just go to sleep when i'm supposed to guess. well i'm kind of used to it now so i just go on to the day probably looking looking tired and. like i'm kind of used to feeling tired i just do what i need to do and sometimes if i'm able to if i'm at home and don't have huge commitments yeah i might just like i said earlier just take a nap or something read my book watch tv whatever. lately have i been feeling. kind of down. on myself down on life. well i have this pending need for separation / divorce. i'm worried that i made a lot of mistakes with my girls now they're teenagers you know on the verge of adulthood. and so i worried that you know i did all kinds of things wrong with their guidance in their early childhood and now it's too late. like i missed out on a lot of things. and yeah i need a job i'm unemployed i don't know what i want to do with my life i know i want to do something and i just wish you know i never did finish college unfortunately because i was traveling and stuff. so i regret that extremely. and i need to get a job and be able to take care of myself cuz i need to. divorce and move on with my life so now i forget what the original question was but that's the state part of the state of mo. no. yes. well. the first time or or or recently. the first time i guess was you know when i was in my early twenties i was just a little upset about constantly that was another breakup i had to make back then i was. in my early twenties and i needed to break up with my boyfriend but again it was very upsetting cuz i. you know it's hard because he didn't want to break up and i feel like i was hurting him and i didn't understand this feeling i was really upset. how did that was my first time having depression so i didn't really recognize it as depression but i went somehow i had the. knowledge or the i was able to take myself to a psychiatrist i remember i paid for her by the hour and she prescribed xanax to just help relax me. and so i guess that helped me get through that and then i've had depression throughout the years just so you know little bits here and there for various reasons such as i guess it's usually a relationship you know. yeah so the most recent time i was diagnosed and put on meds that was probably about 2 years ago. no. money and i don't have insurance otherwise yeah i'd be happy to go to therapy anything that might help. tell me about the last time you felt really happy. last time i felt really happy. i don't know i guess maybe. when my children were born. i guess happy i just you know i always wanted children so it's nice. to have them. that's i don't know that's all i can remember of that and i guess i don't remember the good times too well i remember the bad times. something you did recently that you really enjoy. something i did that i really enjoyed. well. that's the way i am. friday night i went to a friend's house and met up with five other girlfriends and we. we created vision boards and talked and had dinner at one of their house that was that was fun. we get to. stay in college get my degree. get therapy trying to become happy. yeah try to figure out things earlier in life. like. yeah. stay in college and and mainly i think the mean and what it all boils down to no matter what your depressed about it seems like. as soon as the saying goes in the. songs go you know it's all about money the world revolves around money in. having none that in itself is for depressing so besides relationships and different things that have happened in your life having no money as you know it's like you can't even try to fix anything because you don't have the money to fix it so with that in mind i would definitely advise myself to get my college degree and to get a job and stick with it don't quit to go traveling and i'll just stick with a job sick with a company build up your seniority keep your benefits. and build up some knowledge or some expertise in some sort of filled yeah that would have been my biggest piece of advice to myself. not much. i guess. just my daughter's you know there are two beautiful daughters and. i'm proud and glad that i was able to have children some people. aren't even able to do that you know and they try so hard or they look back on their life and they wish they had done it so that's the one thing i mean i wanted five children and i always wanted a boy which i never had but i guess that's the biggest thing i can think of to be proud of. having my two daughters. i'm a very loyal. friend and person that's why when that friend betrayed me i was so devastating. yeah very loyal very. happy was i going to say i was going to say happy go lucky i don't know where that came from very i meant to say friendly and caring and. yeah i care about people. and i'm interested in people. and i care about animals as well actually that's another thing i'm proud of proud of being a vegetarian. yeah so my daughters and being vegetarian and i'm a vegetarian because i really care about feelings of other beings not only humans but animals to in. you know i don't think that animals should be tortured and live a torturous life just so we can eat them. so what was the question. remember the question. okay. you're welcome by. i did need the tissue one time so that's good. the other

40,197,cool. all right. cool thanks. hi i'm ali thanks for coming in today. yes. i'm good how are you. i was born in hawaii but i grew up in colorado. yeah yeah. how about some 7 to 8 years ago. i should go back once it once or twice a year. it's. how does it compare to la it's it's different it's not as busy there's more things to do outdoors in the mountains on my fan. for work. yeah i am i love it here. it took about a year before i really felt comfortable but once they got through that kind of hard year it was pretty good out here but a good time. i love that i can go to the beach i love that it's warm most of the time i love that i've met a lot of people that love the arts as much as i do. the traffic just like everyone else yeah. yeah this traffic and it's pretty much just traffic earthquakes. not as much as i'd like. it's just nice to go someplace new experience something different. i want to hear that. i went to alaska couple years ago and that was really awesome i got to go fishing in the ocean and i got seasick that was an awesome but it was cool i saw a bear in real life a bear walk through a yard is really different than la was way cool. english creative writing. well i always wanted to tell stories so it just made sense to work on riding and somehow some aspect. yeah i am. to have my own tv show where i write it and everyone watches it every week and it's awesome. really hard. cuz there's a lot of people that have the same dream so. yeah. more outgoing than shy. i like talking to people enjoy other people. take screensaver. go to the movies or turn on music dance. pretty good. i was at work couple about a month ago about a month ago i got mad at someone because i didn't think they were they were giving me clear instructions and so when i try to have a conversation about it they got mad and then i got mad and we got mad. i felt like i wasn't being heard or listen to and felt like we weren't able to have a real dialogue so because we couldn't have a dialogue i felt like no one was listening to me. totally. no ragrets. i yes. i don't know if there is one i mean i'm sure there is but one time i was driving behind someone and they will they cut me off and i think it's just been one of those days this was like a year ago or two years ago it's just one of those days where i just didn't want or i just been a frustrating day when this person cut me off and i almost got an accident with them i just followed them to their parking spot and actually i'd haunted them and they they flipped me off and so she's really really going to my skin would cut me off and almost caused an accident and then and then flipped me off so i followed them to the spa and i asked said miss why did you put me off when you cut me off and and she said oh you know i'm i've had a rough day i don't need your attitude and her daughter was with her and i told her well you're not releasing a very good example for your daughter and you know i didn't need to be petty like that but i just i wanted to be a guess. tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to. get you going deep is the hardest decision was coming out to my mom telling her i was gay i mean it wasn't hard cuz it was the right one but it was hard to do because my mom is very conservative and she she had trouble accepting and it it took a while but when she did you know everything is better and i knew it would be but it was just hard in the moment to you know tell her something she don't want to hear. when i was little kid my. my grandfather found our dog run over in there on the road and he. and brought it in and buy them over as a kid just like seeing death like that really just threw me off and frighten me and i was just one of those moments but like i guess i wish i hadn't been there for it because my grandmother was destroyed she was just so sad and she was woman's i guess you need as a kid but i didn't really want to experience like losses like that in your face. our relationship and our family is pretty good we find out as close as most but we do know we was we don't talk often but we talked with love and we always love each other when we see each other. my grandmother was very positive she was always very encouraging and told me to you know pursue my dreams and not to let little things get me down so glad i had her. how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep usually it's easy sometimes it's not. wife in between jobs recently i start a new job next week but while i've been off i haven't been working i tend to like my body wants to stay up later and later and later and i'm trying not to like fall into the pattern of going to sleep at like 2 or 3 and getting up at like 11 so i keep trying to make myself go to sleep by like midnight or 12:30 and i just end up laying in bed for like an hour or an hour and a half and i should be i should i should be able to just go to sleep and get up at like 9 but. i want to stay up i guess. a little scatterbrained like today i'm a little scatterbrained cuz i i tried to go to sleep early again and i ended up tossing and turning and. so scatterbrained. most of the had a lot of time on my hands like i don't usually have this much time on my hands so sometimes it can be frustrating because you don't know what to do with it when you're not working i guess but. yeah i think that's the question. i just thought maybe a little more absent-minded than usual just lately with the the not working thing. no. a couple days ago when i got my new job i got hired. outgoing listening attentive fun loyal. bank. help. i wish that i. i probably should have looked better i wish i had more hair up here losing a little bit if i wish i was a little skinnier this is girdles pretty tight and you know sometimes i wish i had more money but. nothing too drastic i'm okay. yeah. hoo. when i was a little kid i was i was the fly was the fat kid and remember i was like i was going to high school and it was like the second day and i remember this guy came up to me and was like he was like pretty nice to me i thought midnight realize he'd like this like out of a movie right here put band-aids on my back that's it like i'm a fat cow until like like yeah like just a bunch of mean stuff and i didn't know i walked around with it for like half an hour people laughing i didn't get it and then find this girl is going to me and was like hey there's like band-aids on your back that's kelly's mean things and then she just walked away she didn't like help me take them off and i remember like i couldn't get them i was trying to find him and then i just never liked putting my head in my locker and like i didn't want anyone to see me cry so i just like what made out of my locker and like pretend like i was looking at stuff my backpack but really i was going to know. the crying fat kid who can get the mean stickers off his back. anyting. probably. yeah. you know. i would i would try to keep trying to let myself know 2 to look at things positively and not like we would have people think about you and i spent too much time as like a adolescent worrying what people thought of me and as i got older i didn't care as much and i start enjoying life a lot more so. i went to coachella it's a music festival it was 3 days with all of my friends and my boyfriend and we we danced and me went swimming and we barbecued and we laughed and had a great time. oh i guess my mycareer humble as it may be i really stuck in la a long time when it was when like it was hard i

of change perspective because i saw the wells fargo logo they know it's american but they thought it was let you know. what is told me it's all ridiculous to me because you go to a place you know you

1,6,"it's kind of fun this weekend. okay. cool thank you. and please. are you okay with. yeah i'm totally fine it be confidential or not you know my words everybody's get wild. i'm doing pretty good hanging out nice weather i just had a recent change of feeling just now looking at you the digital you that i'm saying i don't know if it's yeah it's funny. because i'm just always thought that the conveying of emotions or feelings. do you like better understood with a human interaction as opposed to a non-human entity such as yourself. yeah. i think you see what i mean i'm from born and raised in los angeles venice area marvista specifically that's where i'm from. well. a lot more that i don't like but what i do like is that public transportation is coming up. that's the idea of certain you know medical drugs like marijuana is a prevalent in a topic very thought upon and i feel that los angeles is deep culture is why i stay here and pursue my art because there's a lot to that's a lot to gain from the different communities if you understand yeah. well the. the human mentality here is. is very is very hectic very chaotic in a lot due to the vehicle the car the freeway and this idea that were on a grind you know this yeah it's it's a very it's very hectic atmosphere human atmosphere that is not very conducive for a supporting living community to help each other out kind of thing. well i can't see your shoes but i love to travel i do love hiking i do love surfing swimming biking riding taking rides i do love to travel you. i'm from my travels it's not like well i do enjoy a lot of things about travel but it's more like what do i it's it's just more like i enjoy not being trapped in the city with all these made up ties and restraints i enjoy traveling because i get to see the world as it really is instead of this photo image in a man-made image that it is here so i love traveling because i get to get out of this and see the world as it is. thanks. would you. okay well i am. kind of recently last year went to los banos central california area and although it wasn't that far from la it was completely different energy out there is no phones there's no wi-fi there's no tv there was there was sanity there was a relative insanity in the sense that people weren't diluted and getting all of this input from digital media and outer influence people are just real real and hiking and chilling i was working in a hot spring resort. and i just got to breathe and hike and farm and do a lot of carpentry. i'm not hard you don't you don't even think about difficulty when you're doing things you truly love and enjoy so it wasn't. i guess. kind of what i described about the city i just wanted to get out of here and. kind of just get out of here really and just experienced the real the real deal. i'm well. currently i'm studying. currently i'm studying physical therapy i'm about to become licensed massage therapist but before that yeah it kind of cool but before that i was going to. i'm for music composition so i was just writing scores for films animations dance productions theater productions stuff like that trippie trippie it is cool but i had to leave that because tuition hikes up to you now going up to like 50 thousand a year for like a four-year bf not not the deal not trying to trap myself with these chains of federal loans. so yeah. hey that's not a good word sex. dream job. my dream job would be. anyting. that i can do to alleviate these metropolitan like cities from the nightmare that they've been put in my dream is to alleviate the nightmare my dream is to incite dream back within the modern human worlds and within a physical therapy and artistic expression i've got some. great ideas yeah. i guess my ago and i just like i just like experiencing things so outgoing yeah. i thought that was really funny what i do to relax is. can i breathe it out chill maybe make it smoothie or some tea i'm going to go bike riding rides. pretty good i guess i haven't yelled in a long time. when was the. what wasn't arguing i don't i don't really argue much i just like to save my opinion and have it be understood and i like the person i'm conversing with to say their opinion and have it understood so the last time that happened was. i guess yesterday chilling in downtown with a friend from new york and we're talking about riding and basically we were not arguing but talking about opinions in that sometimes things are not ready to be written. yeah so yesterday. kelty. stuff i haven't had that feeling in a long time guilt what about you what something you feel guilty about. okay. i don't really wish i could erase anything from my memory cuz then that would just be like i would feel something was lacking from my current present life if something just got erased hang a butterfly effect, like yeah. maybe the time. i'm sure she was going to school i was taking the year off and i was just kind of hanging around but we had an apartment together with another friend and it didn't turn out. you know not all nothing turns out as it start to be and that's kind of a beautiful thing about it but this one turned out a little. a little different actually quite different than i thought it would be in i thought it was funny but yet ended up on me leaving before the lease ended and i'd actually ended up here with the separating but that's something i wish maybe i handled a little more thoughtfully. the hardest decision. maybe maybe not hard disk but a hard decision to make was leaving school dropping my continuation of achieving a bfa. yeah that could have been the hardest. chester i don't. i mean of course money money is the motto money is a big issue tuition hikes going around the whole nation not a fan of that not a fast not a fan of support that but. yeah that's probably one of the biggest reasons why i just don't support these crazy tuition ax going around and. but another reason why i. decided to leave at to make a hard decision to decide to leave was also because the art institute you know that's it the funny idea and itself already and basically i was a musician. being taught by a musician. to make music and same with you know all that of the dancers or the theater students you know getting taught dance to to a dancer from a dancer how to dance you know and it's just. yeah it's just not quite as artistic as i thought art would be our art comes from somewhere summersweet and deepen purple and not not from out there he knows so yeah. okay. how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep. if i. if i am. it's kind of easy i mean it depends you know if i remember to make some chamomile tea or fi. remember to breathe and go through my montresor. remember to do my pre like dream therapy work then i can get into a real nice but if i just get diluted with all my thought that it takes a long time until i remember to breathe yeah. i'm yeah basically just what i said just breathing or you know if i'm hanging out with friends coming home late and if i get the lucky chance to be medicated from you know a nice and i send a car then it really does you know it indica does put me down pretty nice pretty drowsy so a lot of things breathing you know in a medical herbs like chamomile and cannabis and. just a going believe in myself of bad bad juju. i guess not if i can't think of something now. i've been feeling. kind of like kind of like this kind of just cruising on a on a gray line but it's a nice grey it's really nice hue. some people wouldn't like this but i really like that and it says it's stable. that sits comfortable yeah. no no i haven't. not by a certified medical professional now but now i haven't. can you tell me about. yeah i mean i just think like the whole you know like you said ptsd depression and you know other in a mental instabilities i think everybody is depressed i think everybody is overjoyed i think everybody's angry and everybody shy everybody social all at the same time you know it's just different days different you know variance different floats different boats you know different waves different swells so yeah i think. i'm depressed i think i'm really happy i think i'm really angry i think i'm really friendly you know all that but just on different very different floats. really happy. i am going to feel really happy a lot and i feel really sad a lot but really happy was yes maybe this morning when i was just biking over here enjoying the sun enjoying the breeze biking. yeah it is. well a lot of best friends and

3,17,glass is pretty fashionable. so just give her a couple seconds and then she'll start. okay. hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today. yes. very well. ohio. finish school came out to start my life. not often now not really often. all because my parents have both passed away and so that's my reason for that was my reason for going home. prayer. i've just really not a comparison you know this is warm and. sunny and that has four seasons so it's a very different environment. i it took a minute to get adjusted to the different culture but after i was adjusted you know the sunshine keeps you here. i love the weather i love the fact that i have the ocean and the mountains and so many things that i can choose from and the diversity that i find here. can to not have things that i don't like because where i am i know that i'm finding myself there so and i like me so that means there's really nothing i don't like. yes i do. i love being able to explore different cultures be able to meet different people have a different set of experiences and at the same time to be able to find the commonality between all types of people it's a very rich experience. which one to wear. i guess i'm thinking about egypt and the wonderful experiences that i have their as i go the people and the. warm and loving experience i have the knowledge i get to pursue through the exploring the temples and the pyramids excetera things like that. there are so many there really are but i can think of seeing a baby in a mosque which was just really pure and it really stay with me how similar we actually all our that's probably one of the things that i remember most from one of my very first trips are there and let's see just the interaction of the people food you know incredible i love the food to. nice. wow i study lots of different things that studied law i studied entertainment i studied communications i've studied whatever i want to quite a renaissance woman. it's just always been my way to really explore all of the things that i enjoy keeps me fresh keeps me happy keeps me alive and just allows me to be able to. be fully developed as a human being being able to do that. i don't have a dream job per se what i do have is a desired or just be able to be free to do whatever it is that i choose on a daily basis so. probably more outgoing. well i start my day out there relax because i start my day with meditation and several other spiritual practices that i performed before i move around i get exercise so that i keep everything humming everything moving and then move forward from there. excellent. i don't really have one anymore. argued. cannot remember the last time that i actually had an argument. channel is about. i imagine the last time i argue about something probably might be related to money. situation i wish i had handled differently. you know i try to take each experience as they come and try not to have regrets to hope guilt about the way anything went because they're all for me very positive learning experiences that i get to explore who i am through so i don't really see them as needing them to be different i need to learn from them or to just really accept what is. hardest decision i've ever had to make. don't really have a hard decision you know because i grew up and away where my mother was extremely wonderful and the way that she always taught me to know that it was my own life and so she would never make decisions for me she always taught me to say she would always say it's your life and so for me this is don't really come as difficult to make they're pretty easy to make because i've been making them since childhood. i don't really have a most difficult decision i've ever made. event that i could erase from my memory i don't really have one that i can think of that would be so terrible that i would need to. erase it again everything for me is a learning experience so there's nothing really to regret or erase. how is your day. a very easy soon as i hit the pillow i'm out. great a little more. physical exertion then normal but still great. no not overall but again i attributed that knife credit that to the spiritual practices that i perform on a daily basis they keep me pretty even-tempered. no. no. that's pretty much every day i feel really happy everyday i'm thankful i'm grateful for my life and i'm just thankful for everything that comes into. very smart very loving very intelligent. funny outgoing. i probably probably what my friends would say. there's really nothing that i think i need to do to do or to have her to be different about myself like i'm okay with everything the way it is really am. what advice would have given myself 10 or 20 years ago to know. to understand that everything that happened 10 or 20 years ago was important in terms of developing the person that i am now and. so to just be able to go with the flow and go with the experiences of life in order to be able to learn how to move effortlessly through any situation that comes up. recently really enjoyed. i cooked a very wonderful meal cuz i love cooking. something i really enjoy. wow my my willingness to get to know myself through travel through exploration through practices and through the practical application of everything that i learned about people cultures places and most importantly you know the god within me.

6,52,what is my hair doing over there so i see myself again. it's a little better. so this is mimicking her actual positions. total ask someone to have a conversation kind of threw her. okay thanks. hi. i'm not a therapist. are you okay with this. so how are you doing. all right. originally originally i'm from korea. i went out with a year old. yes. almost never ever been to korea once. i love the weather and being by the ocean and the culture has a lot of things to do with the food was a lot to like. the traffic. it seems like. we're having a lot of economic difficulties in the parking tickets or super high sometimes i'm really annoyed by our government. i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i have not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot. fire shoes. did he say buy your shoes. your shoes aren't showing i have traveled a bit and sort of traveled i haven't traveled in a little bit in a little while. oh just. it. it helps you keep things in perspective about our life here it's exciting and it makes me feel like i'm actually i'm really living cuz sometimes we're stuck in this bubble here in la and seeing other places you realize that you know life is about a lot of different things that you don't think about everyday. well. one of my trips i went. i went to singapore and then to thailand and it was when i was with my ex-boyfriend and we went to. he had he was a sales engineer for a systems engineer but he he did well that year and so this is kind of like a company thing so we went to singapore for a few days and that was really interesting you know of course it's a lot different over there it's not just like going to canada or something but they had a big reception in the evening we got there and they had like a play put on by the principles of company which is all fun and after singapore we did some chores in singapore this really isn't interesting experience it's really clean there and it's really it's not a lot of crime but the government is very is it's a little bit imposing but it was very interesting then we went to thailand and that was almost as really completely different cuz like jungle we went to. phuket little island and it was just it was very primitive compared to singapore just in a lot of different ways with her and just bring it was nice and everything was very cheap had a massage on the beach for $8 and it was interesting. he has an hour for $8. well i'm in school right now and i didn't i didn't finish school and i was younger because and. had health problems. so here i am i'm i'm just doing my general ed right now i'm going to smc. yeah i'm happy. call my dream job would be to be a veterinarian but i probably not very realistic for me at this stage in life and you know also because of monetarily ocelot but that would be my dream job working with animals and and and in a veterinary capacity. i think i'm right on the cusp it depends on the environment and the people i'm with and how comfortable i am but i'm really outgoing when i feel comfortable with people and i'll be really reserved if i'm not. well i mean aside from sleeping. i like like relaxing things like going for a bike ride on the strand or if i'm at home i'll just like reading. a lot of times i can just lay there and. my mind might be doing things but i'm kind of relaxing. i really good i don't have. i would say there's certain things that. they can really like make me. like when i see injustice has or things like that then. i mean i can really feel it but i never just likes laugh a handle or throw things or even you know yell. show me some arguments i mean just like a disagreement or an actual argument. i would say last summer. when. i think it was after a baseball game there's a group of us and we went to. we went to have shabu-shabu after the game and and i think. and i know it's it's it's kind of a tenuous friendship like she's a good friend in some ways and she's a traffic kind of distant in other way so i don't consider her like someone that i would confide in and you know it was any problems but sometimes we just have she's very touchy and she's got the same sense of humor i do so i think she had said something to me during the night which kind of bother me but you know i just kind of. that's just how she is and then i guess i said some things that she. spell were. i wish he gets really offended easily i think but after that we didn't talk for a while but then we then one day she called me up and then we're friends again. but like she never has never confronted me. ever had. hardest decision. it was leaving my ex-boyfriend. how did you do. well. it wasn't. it was a long time coming i mean i was thinking about it. for like 5 years. you know he wasn't like beating me or anything he's a really good guy but we just had a lot of. we weren't always on the same wavelength and we did have a lot of like disagreements so i had thought about it and thought about it and. we are already engaged but we've been together for a long time so. i don't know. i was always is always on my mind like should i get married or should i not and then finally we were just always having. we're always went with the word i'm looking for. we were just having these little snippy disagreements all the time and then one day we had one and i just decided that i was going to leave and i did. it was really hard it was it was the hardest. decision of my life and i can say that definitively. and. but i i think it was for the best. who's probably leaving my job. for well to help my friend start a business in nevada. and when i when i i really like my job i mean it was it was pretty good it was right over at the beach and when i told him that i was leaving then they offered me this huge raise and they offered me in a different position which is awesome. and that was really stressful for me because. i already promised my friends have to leave i would have gotten the position you know offer if if it wasn't. for her wanting me to come over there it was really really stressful and i stress over it for about three weeks until i actually laughed and when i went over there. like we had we had made agreements about how much they were going to pay me and blah blah blah when i got there everything like she didn't remember telling me that i needed a certain amount and the other principles of the company where you know it was a hard situation cuz she had she had talked with me but they hadn't talked with me and they're like well that's too much and also they were a different religion and it was very strange and they were all when i was i was surrounded by mormons and i don't have anything against mormons but it was very different because i was kind of an outsider there and then also the weather was just it was absolutely awful there so i would say that's when it's it's it's. it just a pivotal point in my life and i think that. i really wish i had just stayed. well if you can erase something from my memory then i would probably say. memory. like really if if i could erase something from my memory what would i want to erase everything. can we think of anything i mean. even like that that bad decision that i made. you know it has value in it so i can't really say that i would want something erasing maybe if i was like raped or something and it was really horrifying then i would but i don't. well if your time about being in a deep sleep i'm in a deep sleep a lot but. i never feel rested and that's it's a medical problem of mine. can you tell me. well i always feel like i haven't slept for two days and. there are points in in the day. i would say during some days are points in the day where i really feel alert and alive and and rested but their short-lived. but i sleep a lot i sleep. pretty crappy physically pretty crappy. no thanks. now. i haven't been officially diagnosed with depression but. that's that's usually what doctors. like my sleeping problem hasn't been diagnosed i'm i'm in the process of really working to get it diagnosed but that's the first thing that they try and. figure out they they've given me like depression drugs before but they haven't helped with my sleep. but i do. i do. i would say i feel down sometimes. my life is very strange right now so there are a lot of reasons to feel down i would say that i do feel down sometimes a lot of time but it's not. i would say is reasonable considering the situation that i'm in. okay. i need triggered by something. they're just triggered by tech that my health is is not great and it makes it makes life really difficult but. i wouldn't say it's triggered by anything in particular. oh there i mean. i mean for a long. of time or every night i experience happiness like when i go out with friends or i go and you know i've. find some great new dish i like i mean. what type of happiness are you looking for. well. i mean right now. my friend just had surgery and so i'm staying with her this week i'm really enjoying it i mean even though we could never live together i can never live with live with her long-term and i'm sure she couldn't live with me long term but i'm having fun and. you know she just she installed the groupon app on her on her phone yesterday cuz she's been paying too much for laser hair removal installed it on her phone and then today she's she's looking up cupcakes so she had me pick up cupcakes on the way here to bring back to her as a groupon deal so i mean you know there's a little fun things like that. how your best friend are you. probably. ocd. and. probably thinks i'm pretty prissy compared to her. i think that she would. say that have a good heart or very different. it probably that i am. i should ask her. i know we go out so i think she say that i'm fun. but she has mentioned that i'm i'm a very private person and that i know i've i knew before she said that. why. i have what i told you i have i have a lot of problems right now. and. so i don't really. tell people about them. it is kind of a kind of a killjoy but also. people can feel i feel that people can feel less comfortable if they perceive that you have a have difficulties and they feel kind of. it's just uncomfortable like oh they maybe they should help her they feel guilty but they have busy lives so it's kind of traits of gaap but i would say even before even before this difficult time in my life i've been. i put a private person i don't know why. i think a lot and i'm a deep thinker. and. maybe it's a. you know it. not like i feel like i feel abnormal but maybe i just have a lot of thoughts that don't seem doesn't seem appropriate to share with people or not sure. well one thing that i regret right now is. yeah i haven't really found. somebody. you got to spend the rest of my life with so i would tell myself to concentrate more on that cuz once you hit 40 it's it's it's a lot harder. i would say. that i persevered i'm very proud that. even though i have a lot of. difficulties in my life. the fact that i'm a male making this commitment to go to school and i'm doing it on my own. and. you know it's. it's kind of a. if people if people knew all the problems today have they be like well you know why are you worried about school but. i really feel that. you know i'm i'm doing this and i'm really proud that even through everything and getting a raise. okay thanks. hi.,1,1,5,0.049816564,0.95018345,,,,,422

while and then watch tv have a cocktail with my husband and just relax that's what we do and you know because we have a lot going on we don't stay up too late song. like to watch crime dramas. really mad probably not a lot. i get frustrated with for example my daughter does not clean up her room almost ever so that that gets me angry but. in terms of like really getting like heated langer i mean other than like little things that my children do you know especially my oldest child is 21 you know he can be confrontational cell. other than that nothing really gets me like really angry. haven't i have haven't felt that. contributing to society helping. helping to raise responsible people i guess. and of course the love and affection in the the sun and the excitement that goes with it and all the stages that go i mean like really right now i'm in a stage where my children are either adults or teenagers i only had i have one 11 year old and the rest are all teenagers and adults so it's really fun because we're able to talk about current events and all kinds of stuff that's going on in the world and you know have to have a challenging discussions and that sort of thing so it's it's a different level than when you're taking care of babies and you know changing diapers and that kind of stuff. the hardest thing is that it's 24/7. you never not a parent you know it's and so you have to accept that and that's i remember when i first with my first child thinking you know when i brought him home from the hospital this is it i mean there's no going back you cannot change i mean i guess you could if you did something horrible but i mean the normal circumstances you can't change that and it's a permanent thing and. it is in some ways it takes away your freedom but in other ways it gives you a different sort of freedom. always. i'm sorry i didn't get what you said. some of the things that have been a positive influence in my life most importantly my church and my face but also my husband he's been a really. he's kind of his very like logical thinking and very grounded so if i get emotional or i get upset about something he's always we balance each other out likewise if he gets upset about something i'm able to balance him out so it's been it's been a great gift in my life. i don't think i'd be categorized as somebody with a temper occasionally i occasionally i get angry but i don't like have like rarely do i have outbursts i'm more more likely to you know to say what i feel not let it build up so you don't like my husband and i don't. rarely fight like have arguments that are yelling and screaming or anything like that it almost never happens because i like i said i'm more of a type of person that communicates on the spot self i'm thinking something i usually communicate it right away instead of letting it build up. usually i'm arguing with my older son because he you know he thinks he knows everything he's 21 years old so he has the know-it-all mentality and i'm just telling him that he doesn't know it all and you know i was like was on hiller and more and he's very confident and very self. cell phone with the ra self-assured and so he thinks that you know everything he does is correct and he still has a lot of learning to do that's all. it is a can be. i think that many of them are spoiled and living environment of. of instant gratification which i think is going to be detrimental to the to the future of this country but. in a given that with all the technology we have is really not any way to go back so i i have hope that they will i mean i think this country was built on hard work and an ethics and hopefully our art the next generation and the generations after that can maintain that that standard of living i don't know if it's possible. as loving nurturing funny. we laugh a lot and. caring honest. things that i mean my best i have will actually my best friend is it's two people it's two sisters that i grew up with and we for some years took care of their mother was alzheimer's before my parents got sick so i would had a very close have a very close relationship with them still do and so i'm considered the fourth sister so i would say that those are my best friends and and. we love each other very much is a good relationship. no. no. yes. most mostly mine early depression it was more anxiety probably it's probably been five or six years i mean i've had it off and on all my life but it was never diagnosed originally like as a teenager i think is when i first had started with anxiety but. other than that i let you know so depression kind of goes with anxiety if it's not under control but now it's under control so i have a great huh. no i think it was what they call fleece free floating anxiety more of a organic reason for it in other words that there was a chemical imbalance. in my brain. i've been feeling pretty good actually the holidays were great good family gatherings a little stressed because we're making a big decision right now to help my parents out my dad is really sick and we've offered to move in with them they have a big home but we would have to do a lot of. some renovation and some to help and some obviously moving around and so we're in the throes of that and so that's a big big change but i'm looking forward to it because i really don't want my parents to be alone as they get their in their 80s. so as i get closer to death i want to have my family there with them. not easy usually all my life i think i've always i mean i've always had at least i wake up at least once in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom basically. other than that i mean no not sleep well i mean other than that i sleep well but sometimes if i wake up like really early in the morning then i can't go back to sleep i'll get up and maybe do some work on the computer and then go back to bed and go back to sleep because i want my schedule is when if the kids are have to be at the school early and there's a lot of factors. sometimes it does. probably basically the same i think i might complain the bit like oh i'm tired or my body hurts or whatever you know but i think overall i'm probably the same. my kids know i'll be there i'll tell my get though i'm really tired and they'll understand like my older daughter will be really helpful and letting my the. i will try to cook dinner or something like that so that you know. then they put you in a little bit more. not really not not no. not really. i think significant. actually yes i do i do feel like therapy is useful. well we had a situation with my daughter. she also suffers from anxiety and we have had her in therapy for some time and we just recently our we're about to finish a group with her it was a 6 months. group for dvt it's called and it's like a the first time that is the first time they're documenting using it with teenagers and it's been really good it's been very helpful it's just all about how to live in the moment and how do you know the actual physical and mental strategies to keep you or keep you from your mind from going crazy you know worrying about things or we know. in this case some of the kids have tried to harm themselves or whatever so that's the focus of the therapy and it's been really good my husband and i both have been going with our daughter and it's been really really informational and really helpful i think. oh my god i was she was in a bad way she was being all suffering a lot and we knew it and we acted on it that's all. like. really joyful and happy i would say probably. probably would be in israel when we renewed our marriage vows in the the ethic in cana. so you know where the wedding of cana took place that was really moving and beautiful and it was it happened that our anniversary was we left on our anniversary day we flew to israel on so it was right at the same time it was beautiful. find meaningful and other than that i would say you know like other joyful occasions have been you don't like christmas and you know family gatherings and you know my dad's birthday turned 83 on christmas eve you know that kind of think so. that's an interesting question i would say. once i get like things done that i need to do like if i'm have a lot of a lot of either work to do around the house or. answer one once i get them done i feel like i could sense of accomplishment. you know much like i mean i worked for many years in it as an administrative manager at ucla and. you don't want to get a project done or you get your whatever month-end stuff done or there's a lot of different things that have to meet deadlines or so that feeling of like yeah i got it done you know so i think that would be a no for me the most. most recent way of feeling good and feeling you know like feeling accomplished. dream job. i think i've already lived it i'm also a birth doula and yeah and so i've attended a lot of earth and now i really only do it for family and friends and it's the most rewarding thing you could possibly ask to be involved in is the birth of bringing a new life into this world so i would say that's probably was my was a dream job and i didn't know what i trained much after you know i did my managerial stuff and. with all it is and was awesome so i don't work at a hospital anymore actually the hospital that i work at is now closed but. but like i said it for family and friends. i attended a friend of mine's birth by accident she up she happen to have the same old bs i did with all my children and i came to bring food for her husband when she was in labor we were freaking out close friends and you know her labor picked up quite a bit when i got there she wanted me to say she didn't want me to leave i hadn't planned on it so that was the first birthday i attended outside of it you know myself giving birth which is a whole different experience so after that it was really interesting and interested in possibly setting nurse-midwifery. but then i discovered this thing called being a doula which is really gives you even a lot more hands-on one-on-one contact with the patient which is what i like. so i tried to do that at the hospital in inglewood about 15 years ago cuz my son is 15 and he was a year old mill 16 years ago so. yeah and i've been. well it can be challenging in terms of hours it depends on how long the woman is in labor but and you know also like for me i always tell my friends and family if they want me to be there dual that i cannot guarantee 100% i'm not doing it for business and that way and because of that i don't have like backup doulas that in case i'm sick or i'm not available somebody else could fill in for me so but so far it's been that all the women that have asked me i've been able to be there for some reason still there. the the only one that i missed was one a friend of mine from church who wanted me to go with her second baby i was with her for her first but her labor went so fast you didn't call me in the middle of the night and she was like two hours of labor she would even if it called me i would have been there in time so i went really fast but other than that you know. yeah i've been i've been able to attend all the verse of people that have asked me to do. all of life or in your job. probably might my own births i mean my the birth of my own children. like there's an extreme. sense of joy excitement relief because of course you're out of the pain and then like it's just it's just a matter of you know going forward from there but it's it's like something you can explain it's just it's awesome after you give birth so. and i've experienced both ways i've done both natural and i at my last job was a spy a c-section so i've had both both experiences. all right with my fairchild had kind of a crazy nurse she was a little psychotic but other than that we laugh about it now but when i was in labor it wasn't funny and she. she was not there when the doctor i mean it was my third child was. born very quickly after he broke the water and wolf my husband was there but she was not in there with the doctor and she got in a lot of trouble because i only had like two contractions after that and my daughter was born in the bed so for me it was great cuz i didn't have to go through any of the labor but i'm sure they weren't happy that you fill out a lot of paperwork after that. so. now what i get myself for 10 or 20 years ago. 10 or 20 years ago is probably more not as some relaxed not as. like i feeling out my age that. i don't have the same concerns that i did then it's i don't worry about i don't worry at all about what people think about me i don't worry at all about what you know you know like why i noticed my daughters on mom you can't wear that because people are going to say this i said i don't care you know but they do because it's still in their frame of mind that owe mom you have to dress like this or just like that or whatever so that would probably be at the wisdom that you you achieve with aids that you do see how life there's so many things that are more important in life than worrying about little things. most proud of. probably my family like my husband and my my children i mean the fact that we've stayed married that we weren't intact family that my kids see every day how their friends suffer who who come from divorced families or single parents and they they actually express gratitude sometimes that we are married and we still you know we are still a family so i would say that's probably it. probably the one of my best qualities is being able to listen to people and being able to not be judgemental through the years i've had a lot of experience with. people with problems lot of friends with problems people i know from church and it's just taught me that everybody has weaknesses everybody has problems and i don't think i'm better than someone else if you think you're better than someone else and that's usually to me a sign that you don't know yourself well enough. okay. okay. goodbye. real quick.,0,0,5,0.98518735,0.014812632,,,,,314

last time it's been about five years. not even close more set back out here it's you know you had the weather that's that's that's if i'm not from prominent reason for coming is the weather. because maybe better opportunities and the weather. yes. it took a minute i had to adjust to the different attitudes of the people the surroundings locations and the vast area that someone had to cover to get to one spot to another. the weather off of wonder never end never snows in in in southern california to the prospects of starting a business or becoming self-employed and doing what i like to do. the people. they're not friendly for no no one's friendly out here you know becky sandile from the and was raised in the south where everybody's are cordial friendly high when you passing the streets out here people think that you have some agenda just for saying hello in passing so that's what i don't like about ali. used to used to be on the road a lot i was a truck driver and plus entertainment coach driver for a several i'll motown bands back in the day so yeah so i'm used to traveling yesterday. well this is a this is actually a beautiful country so just doing the countryside of this in different towns different cultures different towns and seeing how they still have the rest of the country our lives. some not-so-good some bad and some good message denver colorado for a couple years which is really a great city and then i lived in atlanta which is a really great state where is you know you had the southern southern attitude southern attitude what is everybody's friendly and and gets along and and the sea i've been back and forth across country least 16 to 20 times so yeah it's it's been it's been a venture. arkansas little rock where i had to get into a you might want to say hi to cason with the rednecks down there because you know i'm african-american and down there they're very pretty as you know there that southern i still have this tendency of thinking blacks or any other cultures besides whites aren't valuable people. yeah sorry i had an incident down there where it actually turned into a shootout. but i'm okay. hello about that you change the time on the. depends on what mood i'm in at the time you know i can't be outgoing cuz i do like to go to nightclubs and listen to live music live bands and i know like i said i i did some entertainment before so at clubs are more outgoing and social events more shy. i know it's not. meditate. very good very good because if i let my temper get the best of me i tend to cause more harm than good time to the person time to myself by you no physical altercations or going to jail so yeah i'm very good at controlling my emotions my temper. good question. okay girlfriend we just recently broke up about two or three weeks ago because of argument about what she thought she could do and what i know she couldn't do what you want to do it anyway so let your argument and argument ended in us breaking up so yeah. emotional. but i'm 55 and it's not my first break up so i just take it in stride in and move on. well it's probably it's no one no no situation actually can be. i feel at the time when you when you deal with a situation at any particular time is probably always a better way to handle it after the fact but i would say back in the day back in the 80s when me and my wife broke up i think i could have handled that one better because i was younger more hot-tempered and more irrational so i could have handled that one better yes. what's the way i broke with the way i handled that situation well being young and inexperienced and and emotions and attitudes and not being able to communicate with another person on the level of understanding. leaving home. well it was like okay i'll say it was about 2 in the morning and i just decided to pack up and and and leave without letting anyone know that i was leaving that was like one of the hardest decisions that i have to make it. sketchy loving for sketchy my family is in detroit and atlanta georgia i mean california la i have no one out here so i'm basically on my own and i've been on my own for a long time so we communicate and we talked and send christmas cards thanksgiving cuz you know and that fact but as far as. family is. it's sketchy. no one. i don't know most things that that i don't want to remember i don't sew and i have erased a lot of things from my memory or place them in the closet which i can't open any more till to remember that so but the most thing that i can say is i won't go into detail on it but i answered netware. because great bodily harm to a person. in the last two weeks with the i've had this heartburn problem so in the last two weeks has been really difficult for me to get some sleep that's why i have a i have in my pocket right now i have a lot of times it's keeping me pretty sedated right now. irritable. and just need to get things done and i feel like i have a people and things that's against me and trying to block everything that i'm doing to secede and that's been a great disturbance to me. yes it is but you know what like i said i take everything with a grain of salt and i keep pushing because you can't stay mad or vengeful at any one person or anyone think too long because it doesn't accomplish anything so i have to keep pushing. i know basic i'm still the same i just just keep my i keep my ideas that i need to do and try to accomplish what i need to accomplish. post-traumatic stress no. yes. back in 09 to 2009. crying a lot not trusting suspiciousness of other people

a chance to express some of the things that i normally don't express and i can acting like blow off steam or blow off a part of my depression. i don't know really really happy when i was really really

11,96,she's going to ask you some questions. okay. so when she done just get the bunny all right. are you okay with this yes. i'm good. i'm originally from los angeles california. i like the weather i like numerous things the women. stuff like that. traffic traffic is ridiculously like it's out of control like the way people drive here. business economics. i just wanted to be a business owner like i wanted to work for myself so that's the reason why i did that. yes i am currently. to be a ceo of a of a company. i shouldn't be that hard but it's going to be challenges challenging give me wrong. i mean sometimes it varies i can be shy at times but then i'm i'm mostly outgoing. sure i mean when it comes to certain things like let's say i go to a club or party and i see a girl i want to talk to you i'll go talk to her but when it comes to being around a lot of people like sometimes i do get a little shy and reserved. i work out. hang out with my friends. that's what i do. i'm pretty good at it. things get to me. when was the. actually it's been a while i have it are you with anybody i mean i had to like a minor little. little argument about something but that was a few weeks ago and it wasn't something that was serious is just. some things i had to clarify with someone. it was the it was about a girl and i ask you some questions about some stuff basically why she was trying to get back with her ex like that doesn't make any sense to me. i would say my relationship with my brother i wish we wouldn't have fought like we i wish you could have worked it out without fighting each other. tell me about your relationship with your family. my relationship with my family is pretty cool like mama get along with my mom. and i get along with my sister so it's pretty it's pretty cool. i'm pretty but i'm very close to my family. i would have to say some friends that i met recently i made some people through my church. can you tell me about that. like a mentor to me. i don't know how i don't think i have anything like that in my memory. that i would that i want to race. i would have to say i would have to have been whether or not to. the sea. as far as like my career path i would say what to where i'm going to get my going to be in and stuff like that. tell me about that. i mean. high school for me went pretty it went okay and i could have done better and basically ended up. not really living up to my potential. i don't know i mean. i really don't know. how is your day. it's pretty easy it's not a problem i can just knock out when i go home at night time. tired. this mainly tired i would say. i've been up i've been fine lately. i have. no. no i have not. no i have not. i would say. it would have to have been. when i when i got the car that i have right now. i have a nice car right now he's pretty fast. awesome. i would say. he would describe me as somebody that's not a quitter somebody that perseveres. no. advice would you give yourself 10. go for whatever i want like when i whatever i want out of life just go for it. don't hesitate. i would have to say carly my way like i i put on some pounds and i'm working on losing those pounds. tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly. maybe when i was little in school probably. can you tell me more about that. pretty much i got bullied so that's pretty much what happened. i'm intelligent on. hard worker. i'm a good person. i would have to say. having like get-togethers with. with my friends. and. we just hang out with each other in and talk about stuff that's going on in our lives and stuff like that. you're right on time. okay is that it.,0,0,5,0.97349066,0.026509305,,,,,393
12,98,all right. thank you. are you okay with this yes. if you want okay little bit tired but for the most part feeling pretty good. i'm actually originally from woodland hills which is out in the san fernando valley was born there and then i moved to lomita which is in los angeles county about probably around 1993 so i'm going to 23 now so it's about what is 19 years or so i've been living there now. some things that i really like i would have to say you know the beach you know not so much the traffic don't really care for that but definitely you know just kind of like the nightlife you know just people in general i like conversing with others so. right dip. you travel. yeah actually i do i mean i can't see your shoes but yeah actually i do travel a lot i've been to places like hawaii been to the caribbean i've been to see you know just different places like arizona i've been to oregon washington pretty much all over i would say so but usually mainly like why the caribbean mexico as well so yep. i think it's just the experience you know i'd like you can't you can kind of experience the culture of different people you know just just the whole background the scenery it's just you know it's it's something new to experience i would say something that you know people haven't seen before so. will it see i recently took a trip to hawaii a couple months ago i was back in december was around christmas time new year's so that was pretty fun we went to a couple different islands we went to let's see i think it was kawaii went to oahu maui you know places like that so. you know i would have to say that you know probably like in hawaii or like the caribbean you know just like i said before the whole experience factor just seeing you know new different things things that are unique so. actually study journalism right now i'm in my final semester so i'm about to graduate couple months. skip. well you know it's kind of funny cuz you know i started off at a two-year community college and so you know i was going into my business management something to do with you know i think basically accounting but you know i kind of figured that wasn't for me so i decided to go into journalism because i couldn't i mean you know it probably still be sitting at a desk but you know lisa journalism i can go on the field and i'll talk to people and you know you know receive information gathering information that sort of deal and then you don't write up stories i just thought it was you i was a lot more interesting for me as opposed to you know just kind of crunching numbers all day so. my dream job i would have to say you know something something and maybe radio broadcasting sports broadcasting you know i think that would be really interesting something that's definitely a passion of mine so. tell me about your relationship with you. my relationship with my family it's it's pretty good you know i lose my parents still like i said i'm 23 years old you know there's certain times when i can be a little bit shaky little bit rocky but for the most part it's it's pretty good you know i've matured a lot in the last few years so things are getting back up to speed i would say things are things are going pretty well. you know i think it's them somewhere kind of in the middle you know sometimes i can be very outgoing and talkative the people when i'm relaxed and laid-back other times i kind of it's not so much like i go into my shell but you know it's times like i can be kind of shy if i don't know people as well or if i haven't never met them before so it's one of those things that kanye kind of got to meet me in the middle with it because you know i can neither be talked very talkative or a x you know i can be a little bit shy but you know once i once i get the conversation going really talkative then so. hey. i'm you know usually i would listen to music or you know maybe just you know can i go for a drive or you know hang out with my friends you know it just something did just the kind that you know he's he's that cuz you know like i said sometimes you get a little bit you know tense and you just want to relax and you know just do the things that you enjoy so. you know i've actually been better with that couple years back unite points were like i pretty much couldn't control my temper like whatsoever and i i mean i would just pretty much get angry you know the littlest things everything would just kind of ticked me off but you know i've definitely learned to you no control that sort of thing and you know it may be a better person because of it. well let's see i'm trying to think it's it was probably something with my family with my mother maybe i can't remember off the top of my head but you know it's it's always something so minuscule that that's why i probably don't remember it but you eventually we make up and i apologize for it because you know i accept that you know i'm wrong and you know certain circumstances. when you feel guilty about. something that i feel guilty about probably you know not being as nice to others as i could have been in the past you know i mean that is the past and you know i don't like this wall in that sort of thing but i think that's one thing that i tried to work on but it's also one thing that i kind of regret not doing just being just being nice. precision i ever had to make a pretty recent kind of tough because i actually have a buddy he was in the air force and you recently got diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia so that was really tough and it's hard for me to talk to him because you know he's not really all there anymore like we used to be so it's one of those things where i feel like i'm kind of ignoring him and i don't want to do that but at the same time i don't know is tennessee's you could be a little crazy so. probably like me on some sort of like traumatic stress disorder maybe when he was in the military so i don't know but yeah. yeah it's pretty tough and i cuz we go way back been best friends with them since i was about five six years old so it's just it's just really hard to deal with but you know i try to i don't i don't you know try to keep in the back of my mind but you know it's it's always there i don't ever forget so. your best friend. my best friend. well you probably say that you know i'm a pretty pretty down-to-earth guy usually pretty honest sometimes brutally honest but you know i try to work on that to you probably say that i'm pretty funny i like to hang out you know just kind of do things here and there you know i'm just normal activities like any other person you know go to the beach hang out watching movies and i'll grab a few beers i started deal so. yeah it varies sometimes it's easier than others you know if i'm really tired and you know i'll probably have a very good sleep i've been sleeping all that great the last few days cuz you know my house there's workers on the roof so they're you're putting in the new roofing so that's kind of tough that always wakes me up early in the morning so sometimes a little bit crabby but for the most part usually get pretty good sleep. feeling lately lately i feel pretty good you know because you know things are starting to look up i actually got an internship about a month ago for you know my field of journalism so that's good about to graduate in two months so i'm looking forward to that i'm starting to make a little bit more money that's you know that's good and yeah things are just going pretty well right now i can't complain. yeah it's it's not bad you know like i said it could always be worse right but you know i'm enjoying life so that's the that's the best part. i've not know. nope. last time i felt really happy man you know it was probably going back to my buddy when you know he was still still had a sanity i guess you could say i came back to visit from the air force you get some leave so you know you're just hanging out no just kicking back having a few beers and just talking about life so that was nice but i miss that you know so. i feel great do you know it because there's nothing like having a best friend and you can have conversation you know 24/7 about anyting you tell anything to him in confidence and you can tell me anything in confidence is like it's hard to find especially someone that you've known for so many years and then you can't really get it back now so. is there any regret. yeah there there's a probably one or two things that i regret well i mean i got a dui about three or four years ago actually was four years ago that's something that i definitely regret because you know i look back on it and you know things might have been different but at the same time you have to accept you know the actions no circumstances that took place so you know i may end up in you. i guess i think i better off for it but at the same time you know it's always going to be in the back of my mind like i said it's just one of those things you have to do within your own way. advice would you give yourself. well you know it's one of those things like i was a child then so i really don't know what to say i mean even if i would have listened then who knows but you know i probably would have told myself you know just be careful you don't make sure you can be the best person you possibly can candy basically you know just always be nice be honest just be caring for others so. probably going back to my buddy with the whole paranoid schizophrenic thing i don't say that i wish i could erase it i just wish that it didn't happen like that so. send your ideal weekend my dear weekend i usually keep it pretty pretty generic i going to hang out with my friends either you know we hang out in the day no do certain things like you know maybe grab a few beers you know just have casual conversation maybe play games watch movies now just the standard stuff that people do if so. what are some things you wish you could change about you. some things that i wish i could change. probably just you know be nicer like i said before baby not being as lazy have more determination i mean i i have quite a bit of determination i know what i want to do with my life but i know there were times when i kind of get a little lackadaisical and so i wish i could improve upon that and not procrastinate is much so. well you know it's it's tough to think back but i would probably say a time when someone made me feel really bad as you know i would say probably like when i was kind of getting angry at certain people maybe just kind of chewing out my friends when i probably shouldn't have i'll try to give him more constructive criticism but at the same time i knew it was probably not my place to say those kinds of things and they were out of characters. okay. the best qualities i would say that i'm definitely hardworking i'm determined a very caring now more than i used to be. very honest and you know i just i love to talk to people like i like making new relationships i like making people laugh. something that i did recently that i really enjoyed you know it's probably over at my internship i was just going to write a story or two and it just felt good you know to get those stories done eventually they're going to go into the paper so i feel accomplished about that you know it's one of those things when you work at something and then you see the product right there you know it's right in your face and you can tell yourself you don't like i did that so makes me feel good. you know just let's see a few different stories that just usually things about will the papers in long beach so it's usually about you know stories are events that are taking place in long beach so. i would say that i'm most proud of you know graduating high school. graduate college hopefully you know i was going to earn a degree and then hopefully get a good solid job you know the near future i think that's one thing that i'm most proud of. thank you. so we value your feedback so. after you take care with your answer.,0,0,5,0.9877165,0.012283564,,,,,379
13,106,okay. okay alright. okay you. inglewood california. yeah. no. that's okay. give me my girlfriend and my daughter. yes. are okc okay cool. yes i do. well i'm football recruiter so i travel all around the world to to sign different football players for sports management company. i'm just the independence about it being alone being able to be free and not tied down to one to one thing you know it's great. i'm i remember traveling to. and take them to clubs and this and that and we're not that type of organization. dishonesty i don't like when people are dishonest that really really really bothers me and not true not on its not real that that upsets me a lot. i tend to just. try to free myself from the situation to clear my mind when usually take a walk or something like that or just just just go in the room by myself and just try to clear my head in my head. i'm okay with it at times but i can definitely be better. oh i already argued with my my lady a couple days ago and it was about our daughter in summer thing she's doing at school and she she wants to raise her one way and i think i want a razor a kind of a different way and discipline her a little more on certain situation so i think different discipline is a big key in a kid's life and she she she was raised a little differently. i don't know just angry upset you know when you're an argument that's what you feel so you do and say things that that that bother you and you just go on with it. yeah a little bit. i don't know i just. that's the way i feel i don't know i can't really say this way i feel. a little a little. i don't know just. realness. honesty truth to spend straight out front. i'm pretty clothes pretty clothes for my family. oh holy night the subjective. they're raised different societies going to become even wilder what the way the kids are raised and no discipline and and the things they're doing everything we we stay live and everything's inflated so much to where it's a skin to a point where it's getting out of hand i think kids these days to a certain extent are or much wilder than i was and and generations before me and just able to do and say and the lack of respect and in all just education-wise is this i think it's just tough times for kids and in the way they act it's it's it's ridiculous to me. i definitely like to watch sports i like to gamble i i like to travel but i can skate i like kind of like a a guy that likes to see different sites and go different places like that i'm a big movie person so i like going to theater stuff like that. i'm actually living it i always wanted to be in in some kind of sports industry and that's what i'm doing now i just my goal was to get a little higher and a ladder and you know my own sports management company but i'm doing pretty well for myself so i am happy yeah. no. no. no. it's okay that's it's pretty easy. irritated. tire. i don't know it's been awhile it's been awhile couple weeks ago. how would you say. no not really. i think he would describe me as a stand-up guy i try to be a good loyal friend and. and i don't think you would describe me like that. school went to school grew up together i've been knowing all my friends for 3 months on my life. there. a very close with my friends and i are very close together still at this age. i'm honest loyal very loyal. i am a hard worker i think i am. tooth hurts and i'm just not the average guy i'm pretty much i'm a different different breed i just carry myself and act a little different from a normal guy. i don't know i just saw it but i was raised and high on my dad was kind of different and he didn't go with the in crowd and i think i learned that from me and my lawton and it's just it's it's kind of. same path i took. yes a lot of things i regret i regret. a lot of dishes in my life. yeah one. i actually let a a lady in my life goal years ago that i thought was my soulmate and we had a big argument and one thing led to another and we decided to take a break and then not in that break i i start dating somebody else and i told her i'm going to go my way and she go away i think that was a big a bad decision very bad decision. you've done anything to avoid you have totally i think i should have took a step back and really just thought about the situation a little more instead of a. being so upset and moving forward. i just upset i tend to get upset and then my thoughts get clouded so i need to think a little more when i'm upset. i don't know just. experience a time been do you know making it making up for your mistakes and and then in. being better about different decisions after you made the mistakes. think a little harder by situation about situations and and things and the decisions that you make us think a lot longer and harder before you may come and i think the outcome will be in a little different today. my grandmother she's always been a positive influence she's a great black woman with old school. the ways of living so i think i have a bad at that to my life is a great woman. and baseball and yeah. i was a pretty good player i was a pretty good athlete growing up i was one of the top. and that started a future event and athletics and that's what i wanted to do so i accomplished my girls who at the time was a great a great thing and still is a great thing it's a great accomplishment of my life. accomplishments being able to fry or if i'm. have a goal or something i'm supposed to do that week or that day and i compliment it always puts me in a good mood or getting my job done and out the way i'm supposed to do it in this in a timely fashion always with mega ball. being a positive role model right now for younger kids that's in our sports academy program i think as i got an older the thought process and the way i look at life is totally changed and i think i got a lot of kids can look up to me that i deal with now and say you know that somebody that that is is a pot of positive of going to my life. oh. couple days ago my football team where in the playoffs make the playoffs so i always makes me happy. thank you. i get by.

14,110,doorbell back over here. alright great thank you. and please. are you okay with. yes that's fine. i'm okay how are you. originally i'm from san francisco. originally i moved here in gosh 1995 then i went to chicago then to san francisco and then back to los angeles probably about 5 years ago. a lot of moving. never. there just isn't anything there for me anymore. the weather is better in la but the people in san francisco are nicer. my husband prefer my ex-husband prefers at here that's why we moved. okay. i have an undergraduate degree in psychology and after that i went to law school. when i was in college i worked at a law firm and decided that i really wanted to be a lawyer it was really interesting. are you still working in that no now i'm a stay-at-home mom. you find it easy to be a parent know i loved it but it is it is difficult you have to manage a life to make sure that they become a good and successful person. it's easy to kind of do the academics and stuff like that you know i'm good at that the hardest thing i think is to guide them emotionally to help him through things that he's having a hard time with feeling like i don't have all the answers. i'm just seeing them grow and and experience new things and learn about life in the world it's just it's really really cool. what are some ways that your. completely different completely different and i am not a perfect parent but i love my son i take care of him he's the first priority in my life and they weren't like that at all. well my parents are dead i didn't speak to my dad at all before he died i have a sister and a brother that actually i don't know where they are i don't speak to them either. do you consider yourself more shy. probably more shy because i consider myself more reserved. i like to listen to music. like what i have i listen to all sorts of music but my favorite when i'm relaxing is that 80s music cheesy cheesy but true. it depends on who i'm with if i'm with my son i can control my temper if i'm with my ex-husband or other adults yeah i don't. so so. yesterday and it was about my ex-husband dating the woman that he was cheating on when we were married. can you tell me about that. i found out he was cheating on me and i kicked him out and he told me yesterday that he's continuing to date her. yeah. really angry. and just really hurt. i wish that i had talked to my dad before he died i wish that i had settled our differences before he had died. tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to. the hardest decision i've ever had to make was actually ending my marriage. because he was cheating on me. that would have to be. well i don't know i mean i don't know if i'd want to erase anything from my memory because it makes me who i am today. but i can't really think of one event that i would want to erase. how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep i don't get a good night sleep it's not easy i wake up a lot in the night. i don't know i wish i knew if i knew i could change it i could try to do something about it but i i just don't i don't know. what are you like when you don't. grumpy irritable. grumpy irritable down. mixed with anger. can you tell me about. it's just because of everything that i'm going through with my soon-to-be ex-husband. yeah there's. i just keep it inside. meador staffing else to really do except i mean it is what it is so. i have to. deal with it. no. yes. 10 years ago after my son was born. 9 years ago i felt like i couldn't cope with life. i was so down i couldn't i felt like i couldn't do anything. i need. no. i don't go to therapy i go to medication management but i don't do talk therapy. i have gone to a therapist and no they don't help. can you tell me if. well some just sit and stare at you and don't say anything you know if i wanted to talk to myself i would others give advice that i think is just. it just not not good and not on point. tell me about the last time you felt. it was probably this morning i was playing with my son. just really happy i wasn't thinking about. any of the other crap. in my life i could just forget it so i was feeling really really happy. i think they would describe me completely different from the way i would describe me but i think they would describe me as really sweet they have really sweet confident. outgoing because that's what i try to be two people so i think that's how they would describe me. i wish i wasn't sad i wish i was more confident. yeah there are a lot of things i think. it would be. to not. not give my life over to one particular person which is what i did with my husband. find your ideal weekend. i think i would spend my ideal weekend in a sunny place like palm springs with my son hanging around the pool having fun going out to dinner. one of my two of my friends to really good girlfriend so i think have been really positive influences in my life. can you tell me if. sure life is worse than mine and the but we can always commiserate together. is just really positive me she's always happy always up always look into the bright side so that has helped me a lot. my son. i went over to a friend's house and we had movie night we watch the grown up movie and had dinner and wine and the boys were in another room watching movies and playing video games and it was just a relaxed fun evening. thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. my. okay.,1,1,5,0.072686926,0.9273131,,,,,421
15,115,that should i move my arms around. and i'm going to start at 10. if it's not it was said don't answer that make sense. i don't ask that that's all okay that's all.. okay. impressive. are you okay. yes. fine how about you. here. yes. the weather. weather mainly near the met the weather sorry. not the people put some of the people stuff like that so. okay i'm cutting you off. not as much as

enjoy traveling. ask a question that's pretty good all i study physics and it's mainly. ashley. run out east community college physics and astronomy research and physics also because i like the type of thing i want me to grass will hopefully that's why i'm nervous sometime from the questionnaire. impressive. professor at a place like usc or ucla it's not that where the professors do three hours work a week in the grasses to the rest. you're actually pretty good at this. i got this lot of people the first one i guess is my physics teaching ap physics tutoring high school even though you just let me to be engineers have a physics major he still was a very good if what he told me you know he's fertile tell me that. school is not about a grave about learning. okay. oh pretty good i think. i'm single so i don't get too many arguments but it's part of my brother about. hiddleswift to play a video game together i know i'm pretty old for this. really close a sedum praealtum pair to see a couple times a week older try to help me with groceries things ipad and a brother i see same same same old same time my sister i tutor her kids my nephew's so i see him but once we go so. yes. because i spend long. of time doing math and reading and not talking anybody message.. i guess i play video games or it'll work out i work out i think a lot i try to at least. i rolled my eyes which happened towards a bad thing and let's put it i think. bad parenting basically parents are more self-centered more than themselves and representations and the kids just do they won't be compared to art their opinion. i guess. thank you. i only have best friend. it's a remember. unbiased obviously but they are. i really good math i'm not really sure if you can't that's why you can't get better than that but thing is it's just have to get recertified conference with it where no matter what it is going to learn in math class. out i am patient i think and i am just went where i can swim i can spend many hours many many many hours would be books that might not be important but they might be important to do anyway that's a bad thing. when i a good workout. google video game small little things like that when something happens when my not researched i think mathematical physics type thing where it goes well that must put a book that puts me in a good mood. thank you. right now. is it that that. research that i did i did make it this far. research why that's all. that's all. interesting. we start off in school read about i say things like that he's a general tutoring hero particle physics and no idea what it is you know it's very complicated because icloud mechanics and you still have that and but you not sure if i should make it and eventually he still has lot of time goes by you reach you as time goes on you can get closer closer emission mexico i miss you realize you are just men as good as we are up there you can do research and visit you can't admit knowledge. okay. a few weeks ago when i got a good grade in the class. thank you. yes briefly. many years ago. i don't know she's always growing up i always thought i was always thought dreamworld the kid that's why and i just we're not doing that. i was national guard or i think about 18 19 i got commissioned at2021 as longing for about a year so i let it 2022. yes. really. i don't think it did i think i just need to grow up your butt or expecting to be as much. graduate school. in physics. no. nope. it depends when i work out really hard at night of the day of the day before if i work out pretty hard as bad if i don't workout it i don't know it's hard moderately. thank you. yes. it's okay. probably like i am now normal i think not as not as happy about everything was still pretty okay still function. no. hey sliding. no. yes. yes i have changed my thoughts. applying to grad school games been a while and slightly apprehensive happy that looks good but every answer is that it might not be good things like that. what do you mean by that is i know so you could peter but i didn't how hard to do these thoughts or how hard is it going to grad school. understand. okay. i agree. no not really. how to keep

16,119,and please. are you okay. sure. i'm okay. small town outside of cincinnati ohio. 3 years ago. i want to see you. compared to a. small. can i do for work grad school. yeah trying to. not easy. people suck. they're just. different. weather. flashiness the how ridiculously rich everybody is. selfishness in people. music. how did you decide to do that. i guess it's kind of like the only thing i love. what's your dream job. singing at the metropolitan opera. pretty hard. chai. star wars happen. not that. okay. what do you do when you're annoyed. take a walk. i'm okay. 3 days ago just. some dude cut me off while i was driving and i laid on my horn and he got pissed off and i got pissed off. not really people don't relate to shouldn't their life they just wouldn't. pac-man butt. they don't do anything here so. what's something you feel guilty about. i don't know. tell me about a situation that you wished you would handle different. i could have. done more to prepare and work a lot harder for the last set of a interviews i had in four. just i don't know really really off my schedule my performing schedule in my prep schedule just in terms of. bringing like a piece of music to other people. how do i get to spend like 12 hours a day working on stuff in training for. the music button. yeah you can always do more than that there's always something more you can do. so. my grass will edition at juilliard. it was stressful. just like the top. 10 people of the past 50 years in your field. and you're in a room for them and. the weather. love what you do or hate what you do. pretty shity. decided to not. marry my fiance. and pursue my career. instead. i don't know. it's not bad. fairly close i guess. can't see your shoes a little bit. and being in a different place. went to san diego. a month-and-a-half ago still. i don't know like the. finishing high school. glad to be leaving. how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep not easy at all. i can't sleep. don't know everything works. myself usual. i just have a lot on my plate than a lot to do in order to do. get where i want to be in. be who i want to be so. working harder. clown through it. i mean i never really sleep well so i don't know i don't i don't really know. no. enough for me. yeah. isabel. high school fish. family made me. can you tell me about that. nothing to say really. i don't know. same should now just feeling kind of useless. you still go to therapy now. not for me. literally has been. cuz it started going to college then i have to. nose. really been going recently. how did the feeling lately. burdened. tell me about the last time you felt really happy. i started learning how to surf was pretty chill. what made you decide to do that. just like but he was doing it so. if it shine. ridiculous. designing your address. i'm being as far along as i wanted to be. don't think about going to law school. get a head start on studying music and. things you wish you could change about your. micron a good 5 to 10 pounds of muscle. i definitely. want to be further along professionally. and sleep more feel to turn my mind off more. ideal weekend. working training. my dog. thank you. that was awkward. computer.,1,1,5,0.056029312,0.94397074,,,,,389
17,120,okay thank you. yes. i'm doing well thank you. from los angeles. sports outdoor sports mainly. surfing snowboarding mountain biking rock climbing. awesome awesome. traffic. yes. experiencing different cultures. well i love going to mexico. and it's so much different from california and western culture so to speak i know mexico's a western civilization but the level of entertainment than the level of education is so much different than they're like two different worlds. traveling you mean. i would have to say going to an island off the coast of fiji and the name is table aurora and it's a very small island you can walk around in 30 minutes 30 or 40 minutes and it's a place where you go to go surfing and it is an incredible visually incredible and experientially incredible place. i studied biology. i was pushed from behind by my father who was a medical doctor and he wanted me to become a medical doctor also. not at all i'm working in areas of business now. yes i am. my dream job would be to be a missionary. yes. my father's initial objective when he became an md was to become a missionary and the he's a very generous person and i think i am too i guess i got that from him hereditarily but i would like to help people and i don't think being a doctor is helping people i really don't i think it's disingenuous to say you're helping people while you're stuffing wads of cash into your pocket i would like to be building people homes and helping them find fresh water sources things like that if i could afford to travel to remote places like that. screensavers. i know it's not. what are you. my exercise. i think i'm pretty good at it. i think i'm pretty effective at it. it was probably two days ago it was my girlfriend and it was about her lack of consideration. i felt frustrated. a situation which i wished i could handle differently. in my later years i would say i don't have many regrets in my younger years i used to be snubbed by people and i would keep my mouth shut and i wouldn't say anything i would not express my displeasure of their actions or their behavior i would just keep my mouth closed and internalize my feelings i've learned that that is so wrong and so they'll probably the last 15 to 20 years i have made it a point to vocalize my displeasure with someone's actions right away and that takes care of the anger immediately. yes say it depends what you mean by trouble i think all the way around once you take the beginning the beginning to the end it diffuses trouble rather than prolongs or protracts the trouble. going back it would be to not to pursue medicine like my father wanted we argued at length for many months and years about this and finally i prevailed and i didn't go to i didn't go that route but that was probably the most difficult. in my life. there was a time when i wished i could erase a female interactions girlfriends than and their betrayals but now i realize that keeping those memories make me who i am today and and dealing with them defines who i am today. oh my parents are deceased i had very good relationships with my parents i'm very thankful for that even though my father was somewhat of a hard handed person we came to an understanding well before he died and my brothers i get along great with my younger brother but my older brother has issues he has psychological issues and they continue to plague him and to affect me also just just knowing that he's going through turmoil. well i guess i really don't cope with it because he's clinically depressed and he has suicidal tendencies and that he's not working he's very highly educated and he really doesn't talk to me and his family is very abusive towards him it's an i'm not a happy relationship for his family. yes. i know i would have to say my father my father is my hero he's my model he's my archetype for what a man should be use unimpeachably honest and kind yet on the other hand he was he had high expectations of me and my two brothers. how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep. usually it wants my head hits the pillow i am dead asleep like a log but lately i've been having just last night i couldn't sleep i woke up at 2 and i have a feeling it's because of a diagnosis of cancer that i received one month ago. with my own personal methods of handling stress i'm okay i'm probably 90% okay that 10% comes from a uninsured nurse about the future about whether i will survive this or not. not really. no. never. never. oh i was either surfing or snowboarding or rock climbing or mountain biking i always experience joy when i'm exercising at a very high level of exertion. funny jovial intelligent perfectionist. that's no one's asked me much about that maybe. to submerge my. hedonistic self. i look at it once again and my father feels my consciousness he was the ultimate dufur of gratification he put now behind him and he put what will be in the future in his sights and he never let go of that and that's what made him the self-made man that he was or as i am looking always for the present how i feel now and it's difficult for me to slog through a mile full of crap in order to get to a prize that is so far away. it would be. my ex-boss and he started using my last day of work when he fired me he started using a lot of profanity toward me and i turned to him and i said you cannot talk to me that way and he continue to use more profanity until i objected to it again and that's when he fired me and that still in my mind and that occurred a year-and-a-half ago. anything i regret oh yeah i regret not getting married and having kids. you've done anything to a boy. sure i suppose i could but i think that. that would have robbed me of the many opportunities i had and i took to travel around the world and experience different cultures because that's what i enjoy the most about life is exploring and seeing different things and talking to different people and expanding my awareness because the united states is not the end of the world it is once you get to trouble you find out that we are not if we do not have the highest level of living in the whole world that other people think that we're the only ones that think that and i disagree. that's a good one i would say i would say to just enjoy life because you never know when it's going to end and i think i've done that and i may be coming to an end soon with this diagnosis of cancer so i think i've done i've i'm happy with my life thus far. i was giving a rock climbing lesson i have a part-time job of instructing rock climbing and many of these people have never done it before and they thanked me and they told me what a great time they had and how this may have changed their lives so that was very gratifying to me. i would say my. devotion to the environment i wasn't always an environmentalist but i have been vocal in the cause of being a steward of the environment because today there are a lot of people people that are polluting the environment with a lot of chemicals and pollutants and septic things like that and i stand up and i have been on tv and on youtube speaking up against these people that pollute the environment. thanks for sharing your thoughts with me and you're welcome. goodbye. it was interesting. okay.,0,0,5,0.8041734,0.19582655,,,,,471

before different languages everything to seeing what the world has to offer. oh okay me and my sisters went to hawaii last year. am i believe we went to honolulu and then tomorrow we here and we met the people in hawaii and they were so nice if i can live there i would. everything was memorable but probably jet skiing in honolulu was very fun. outgoing. music music is much fairview for me. well my family is very musically inclined like my dad and my mom's family so music i've always been like that thing no matter how i feel about her music on it makes it much better. so good to hear. i'm pretty good i used to box so it let out a lot of frustration so sometimes i do that too i go into the gym and i do like a kickboxing class but i don't i never escalated to the point where i like to learn how older now i can control it pretty much. well i live with my sister so i argue everyday but it was over clothes my sisters and clothes always close. my mother and my father are pastors of the church i grew up with two sisters and older brother who was the cop. and we're pretty close i have a nephew we're pretty close like every day we see each other close and we don't all live in the same house but we're together every single day at some point when we lived in that when we lived in michigan my family is in michigan. when i cheat like right now i'm on a diet with my sisters but last night i snuck and got mcdonald so i feel bad because they've been so sticking to it and i cheated but that's pretty good. me and mine with me and my friend of mine got into it and we said things that weren't like we hit below the belt that we and we usually don't and we haven't spoken in like 3 months now and i know that it could have been prevented if we would have just sit down and talk to each other but it didn't make it that far so yeah. tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to me. probably moving here. moving to la because. like i'm i'm really like what we're really close to our family like i skype with my mom and dad everyday so it was hard to go from there to here and them taking care of everything to me and my sister do it on our own it was much different. oh my goodness i'm parents my brother my dad my mom my sister's my family have a great family so my family definitely. 2 years ago 3 years ago my brother was shot on duty. and he almost lost his life but he didn't and for some reason as much as i try i don't tell them this cuz i don't want them to be like i need to you know whatever but i always think about it over and over again and i'll cry about it like it happened yesterday but it happened three years ago just a mere fact of almost losing him kinda yeah. how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep not easy i work as a personal assistant and administrative assistant for casting agent so i'm on call for her whenever i'm never i never get a good night sleep ever. enough. a zombie i'm pretty much you would never know cuz when is work unprofessional so i am tired they never know but i'm very annoyed and very grouchy when i haven't slept. how have you been feeling lately. tired and i have crazy headaches but that's probably from not getting enough sleep and working too much but yeah very tired. yeah definitely. i'm shorter with people like. being in the industry i mean people don't really care if it's all about self and when i first came here i had the i had the personality and attitude of family and love and nice and being here show me that everybody's kind of out for sale fear even though the other girls i work with so i've learned to like cut people off and be short with people when that's not really me but i just see that's how you have to be. have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd. last saturday i did a way in and i lost 7 pounds i was like cited. how do your best friend describe you. care too much. i think about others more than myself so she probably said i care too much i'm loving i'm the person that

20,129,"okay alright. yes. very well. new york. this turn the volume up a little bit. 4change that's good. i want it. wanted to see what los angeles was about. probably took a year to. not being away from my family being away from what i was used to in new york the neighborhood's the people and just getting acclimated to a whole new lifestyle here. all the weather. can't beat the weather generally always nice it's not too hot it's not too cold it's creative i do like in the movies. i like the beach. the traffic is a lot of traffic. some of it sometimes i think people are a little bit colder here then more distant and unfriendly than other places. i was a history major. no. i do i demonstrations in. a high end supermarkets. dog to be a screenwriter. that's one of the reasons why i came to los angeles. it's hard cuz i don't always maintain focus and motivation a lot of other things distract me. i was i've always been interested in films ever since i was a child and i just always do know was rioting and had an active imagination. i've been the last probably almost 10 years i've traveled more than i had in the past while i've always traveled even as a kid my parents would travel around so yeah. seeing new places and seeing people that are different than i am seeing how they live. and taking in the sights. i went to kenya that was probably one of the best trips ever went on on the safari and. just going out in a jeep and seeing wild animals in their own natural habitat was pretty incredible. oh yeah that's one of the great experiences of my life and i also got to a place in egypt at the end of that trip called. sharm el sheikh which is right on the water and it has some of the best scuba diving in the world which is hard to believe that egypt would but it was just amazing how i didn't go scuba diving i went snorkeling. what do i do to relax i do i like to listen to music i like to help and watching movies help me relax cuz it takes me out of you know whatever might be on my mind i do meditate everyday. i like to take walks and nature that's always calling especially down by the the ocean. depends sometimes i get angry and lose my temper a lot of times. i'll do like a form of self-hypnosis and calm myself which is something i've recently learned how to do. this is very helpful. and also since i meditate it doesn't i don't get annoyed at things as easily as i did in the past. some things that make me really mad. i guess i think of injustice. and the world are done to people when it doesn't really need to be that way that we could all get along. and to make the world better. out last night i went to a movie screening. how about independent film and i didn't think it was done very well. so much that we had a fun argument about a about the movie. so that was like now that this happened yesterday so that was that's on my mind. is there anything i regret the other there are have been opportunities in my life that i wished i had. taking them and pursue them. a certain jobs you know when i first got the los angeles i had an opportunity to. become a grip and i probably should have pursued that. how do i decide to do that i don't really understand the questions. take advantage of every opportunity that came my way that says always i think saying yes. any opportunity is is very important in the matter. how you feel you know you have to be confident that you'll be able to achieve what you want to do. now. now. no but i've been depressed in my life. i'll for the most part of i've been feeling good sometimes i feel a little blue i think sometimes i fight if i allow a. regret to come into my mind that can bring me down but i can you know you really get out of it pretty quickly. i'll sometimes financial concerns sometimes. on an opportunity how do i explain it. the financials one way out that i had made another decision i might have more money or my life would be different. not really i mean i feel. pretty much the same. got me to sea kelp for. let's come back to that. well on his health when i did do that. stop pretty easy i don't have a problem sleeping. doodly i'm grumpy. so if i don't sleep well you know i feel tired and irritable. how would my best friend describe me. good question of why i'm definitely friendly and outgoing little bit secretive. probably that i should be there like to see me more accomplished and detaining my goals and it may be a little happier. i think. it's tough at the pants sometimes i'm very introverted cuz i do like to write so that takes means that i have to spend time alone and then when i come out of that i'm extroverted so i don't really see myself as one hard way or the other it all depends on my on the situation in my mood. my best qualities i think i'm caring i think i'm intelligent. i think i'm funny i'm out going i have a likeable personality and people have said that i'm engaging but not oppressive or overly engaging there's a set of a cool detachment. in creative intuitive. yes. last time i felt really happy. i'll i woke up this morning i was pretty happy. at breakfast i was happy. sun was shining. i think like i said going to kenya. what's up memorable experience scuba snorkeling was a really great experience i just remembered you know seeing all the colors in the ocean and out and feeling the sun powerful sun on my back. almost beyond beyond like. 2 minute away this warrant touch with like everything in the universe. that would be nice to feel that way every moment of the day but. what am i most proud of in my life. i think i've. helped. people. and sometimes when they were in crisis. in our britain some screenplays. pat some good relationships. good relationships just being connected with someone else you know. spending time with them and connecting. unemotional. physical and. metal levels. could be a song that i hear on the radio it could be a lot of times looking forward to something you know if i'm going to go to a movie go bowling hang out with people. you're not looking at work and then going to work and feeling productive and put me and puts me in a good mood. you're welcome bye bye. like that like what do you remember what. okay will you depressed and i was like. explain that and then it was like i did something and then it was like well bridge to that, got it got

twice in the past year. no more creature of habit. yes. sometimes i feel like i don't fit into the crowd so it's better sometimes to be more quiet and view everything instead of going in and actively pursue things. probably listen to music and spend time with my dogs. probably people being in. not very very nice to me or seeing in justices or. i think that's about it. pretty good. probably a couple of days ago one of my friends was saying that they were making a comment about how i am and i got kind of upset about that. yeah it does. pretty close. my best friend so i will just one of my friends. and quiet about it and when a person pushes me to a certain point that's when i overreact usually. it's pretty hard i rather the person notice that i'm kind of getting withdrawn and actively engaging me instead of getting to the point where it's like it comes to a point where it blows out of proportion. probably spending time with my family. a new york. very close. my sister and my brother. i know they're just great people. and i love them a lot and they're a lot like me so i feel like i have people that understand me. probably. castle oil sensitive i don't know it's kind of hard to hard question. no. no. yes. gosh i think probably 1997 so a long time ago. i'm just during that time i was just going through a lot of issues and i was feeling unsafe to myself so i ended up going to the doctor can you get meds and have therapy and stuff. not currently ended about like 6 months ago. almost filled the therapist wasn't really helping me i thought we kept on talking about the same things over and over and she wasn't really challenging me and i've been in therapy for a really long time so i just knew it was a change. yes i do actually when i feel connected to a therapist and i feel like it's a really great way for me to talk about what i'm going through so yes i do. i'm better at describing my emotions and feelings i think the biggest thing is when i'm in situations i can see myself reacting one way and i take a step back and see how it can react normally almost in a way also i tend to take a lot of my emotions and feelings and kind of bury them and make them feel like really bad about myself those nice to talk to someone that's not judging that doesn't really tell me like you know they tell me it's okay basically. feeling hopeless all the time not having enough energy to do things i used to like i had a little bit of concentration issues having weird disturbing thoughts sometime just pop into my mind and just overall just feeling kind of crummy about life. sometimes they are like random moments that if there's like a problem with like my interpersonal life or something like that or if i sometimes even seen something on television like sometimes affects me. listening to music or trying to distract myself trying like my therapist told me for the longest time to journal to record things. it's been a tough transition to come here so we'll be being here so kind of half-and-half okay and not okay. i feel like i've been a little bit with more withdrawn lately but that's about it. some days it's great some days it's not more recently it's been a little bit more difficult. i don't know why i have like a lot of thoughts on my mind at night so i tend not to sleep very well and i wake up quite frequently during the night. very groggy in the morning and. that's about it like during the day i tend to yawn a lot and my friends always are like why are yawning so much are you just interested in what we're doing and i'm trying to tell them it's not that at all. play christmas time when i was with my family. just really happy and feeling like everything is alright in my life. have a good sense of lake where i was at that moment being present with myself. play you know it's a hard question i think probably i can tend to read people kind of wall sometime. i like to say i'm good at being a good friend to people being a good family member. i'm a hard worker when i do have a job so. sure i mean that's life so of course there's regrets one that comes to mind is the wish that i don't eat as much so i can be a lot more healthy. don't take things so seriously enjoy being useful and i think that's it. i don't know ask you a question probably my previous job in my employment i worked really well with kids so i did a great job i thought i was a researcher at a hospital and i helped a lot of kids out for about six years so seven years. yeah who's awesome. i was really kind of like reading people and so i decided to major in psychology so then i went and worked in the a.m.. mental health facility and did research with them with the most drugs and depression and things like that so i found a good niche for me. no problem goodbye. hi.,1,1,5,0.05673039,0.9432696,,,,,351

enough some days. when your freelancer it's hard to keep at yourself to consistently be productive. well. i don't know. can we come back to that one i can't think right now. i probably. once when i moved back to los angeles from boston. and. i had a girlfriend at the time and. it was hard to leave i knew i had had to come back but i think that particular move west was. what made you decide to do that. felt it was calling me. and that's where my connections were and i had to come home. i think so yes. erase for my memory. i don't know which i mean i don't know. something you feel guilty about.

do a lot i do enough soon as i get down on myself for not trying harder to do all the artistic things i love to do. well recently. recently i signaled. into a lane this woman was shouting at me i could hear it cuz our windows were open was a hot summer day and then later. i drove up beside her and i said in a pleasant way i said i was just trying to signal to get into your lane and she was cursing at me through the window prior to that and she looked it up or just looked it up for finger gave me the finger and it was just. it's funny sometimes you try to approach someone in just a normal loving way and all they have for you is hate and that did make me feel bad. little angry. no cuz i took the high road. but she preferred kretz i'm sure. go out with friends make dinner recently

25,150,alright wonderful. okay thanks. yeah. i'm okay. i'm from los angeles. oh the weather the weather the weather the weather the beach the weather the beach the laid-back miss the driving instead of public transportation. and a sporty. i really i don't know the lack of i don't know there's not a lot i don't like about olay it's compared to most cities i really it's my favorite and i've lived around the world i love it i love la a lot. i'm sure you can tell by me. yes i've lived in paris and i've been around the world a lot. it's just dumb it's fun and it's it's it's it's it's a blast it's good to see new places it's good to get to get to experience all the. fantastic i'm sites and in in cultures. well i mean i i i tended to actually do a lot of them i probably would do them differently i think i'm more developed as a person now i lived in paris for two years so and i lived in spain for spain was fun spain madrid is a party town and then and then to these were all work they were all work so that was working so it was on his grind and you didn't really appreciate you know what was around you so much and then i mean i still i still love going just to you know vacation spots like a y a n dent tamika i'm still just really a sucker for that kind of stuff. i guess madagascar was pretty much like just really bitching because it was it was in the eighties and it was like you were seeing a lot of people that have never seen white people before according to the guy driving us around i might he might have been lying but it was just it was bitching and africa was pretty much the best senegal and madagascar. i'm right now about to go for an early childhood education degree and then i did a little bit of a paralegal but that was really just to just to get the just to get the skype and i didn't really have any concept of what i want to do now i really do. i have i was saying to rachel actually i don't know if you guys are able to overhear i really think that the way the school system goes right now is it just it it turns people into into i'm just a just a doggy dog. you know i don't like the way i think it's told draining the school system right now and i feel pretty bad for everybody so i want to try to fix that. that would be my dream job that's so i'm excited like i want to go in a direction that i want to go and yeah that would be my dream job is to work with sort of getting kids on it more organic universal you know trajectory. i think it could be done i don't think it would be done via any sort of legislation except here and there i mean that always ends up becoming you know facade in farsi itself anyway but i think there are ways i've always reached kids anyway and i've always felt where i was coming from and so i think you know there are ways to sort of buck the system without even talking to the system. i guess i'm just a combination of the two i don't think. i don't know actually i'm kind of might even be working that out there might be some outgoingness to overcompensate for what's actually shyness and vice versa.. yeah that's cool. i definitely try to reflect and stay in a pretty lucid space is often as possible so. a lot of lying down at the moment i'm in transition so there's just a lot of and i hang out with my dog's a lot so that's quite soothing why i try not to do i don't really do anything that's to can't unless it's time for like time to drive to a job or time to you know go make some things happen meetings and stuff but otherwise i try to stay in a pretty relaxed space most of the time so it's not like breaking but you know and i meant i'm assuming i can't believe summer is coming so i'm going to swim some more to. when i'm truly outraged it comes out and then i i'm i'm i'm hitting some kind of bad part right next time i'm fighting for my child so there are times when i will just cuss up a storm just to get off some steam. a little bit but usually pretty much there's always you know someone in the periphery that gets it and and you know it's like that bumper sticker if you're not outraged you're not paying attention so usually some kind of sanity can prevail. oh well i mean these are also times where i just can't find something in the car and a bit when i argue with people it's been a lot of the times when i'm being flat out you know sabotage drawer definitely when. you know i lost my temper dreadfully with unfortunately the woman that gave me birth because that she is intrinsic and a lot of i mean she's pretty much horrible person so i recently lost my temper with her. i felt like. i mean i i like again i think i should have said this just now i felt in a way good because i get it you know which is as opposed to not getting it which is even worse but i guess there's another side of the bank of the thing to get to to where you can be a little more constructive about it it's like you know you get to a point where you're glad you can actually see that there's a horrible travesty going on but then you have to figure out how to deal with a horrible try to stay. but so i mean i didn't feel like shame i really honestly didn't feel shame i didn't i didn't feel there times when i feel like it was stupid to lose my temper just because there are people that will try to use that against you that's all but i never really feel bad for being angry about what i'm angry about. well when i was pregnant i wish i had. like i said i went through such an awakening about realizing when i was being sort of undermined that that demanding my respect became a huge issue and when i was pregnant i ended up being so disrespected in the place cuz i was being a hippie on the beach for 6 years so i was it felt like i was being so disrespected in the place where i was set to be when the child arrived at i stormed out via what was a good survival mode before but left me jumping out of the frying pan into the fire and they got my kid so. yeah. it's fucked up. i don't want to erase anything from my memory i like having everything consolidated and cohesive i don't and integrated i don't want to erase anything from my memory. well did i get it right or did i get it wrong i guess the hardest decision was whether or not to sign sign mediation agreement with dcfs in and i should have said no let's just go straight to court because that there is nothing wrong with me i just happened to succumb to an ssi check via bulshit with my mother's and i should have just been you know brave enough to just go in there and do that and instead i chickened out and did their mediation and they played me out. over consciousness. it's horrific horrendous borgia quality intrigue and sabotaged it's bad. that's okay. someone that i mean. there's been. you know there's been some. some great people that again from a far i have not sort of really achieved a real great ability to build relationships and i'm working through that great writing it right now and i think that's a lot why don't i have my son but as i've grown in developed i have seen encouragement from like-minded souls and you can see that and say that's wonderful and but otherwise you know a constant you know contact with someone that's really good for me it has been hard for me to get to that point. how is your day. not so easy if he says it all. i'm being i've been i'm not completely centered and then there's been some actual you know people thinking it's funny to harass me or jolt me as they walked by and so there's been actual harassment and stuff like that. i'm still pretty pollyanna doubt i still look forward to head and try to be as pleasant as possible. i'm tired and drained and a little bit frustrated because that i know that i've been sort of that i sort of have a bit of my energy and and space being usurped and i can tell and i don't know how to get through that and passed it. no. no. there are i'm basically a very very very happy pretty much list out person but this fighting for my son has me sort of trudging areas that it is it the same trees that were thrown in my road in childhood before i realize i was such a happy person or thrown there again so i'm going through some of the same pitfalls and mistakes but you know during the day i'll i'll think something completely true and organic and i'll just stare at something to wow that's beautiful and i'll be reminded pretty close to my spirit so i try to stay there 24/7 i'm pretty spiritual that way. i mean if i had one that was willing to say all the nice things about me gets pretty competitive out there that you know that i'm this is off you guys. that i'm funny and that and that. i think that's bad i'm done funny and that i'm good and that that i'm trustworthy. legacy west. just not necessarily change but grow through my ability to connect with the people i want to connect with. and disconnect from the people that manage to to drain me. i already said i regret the thing with them leaving the place where i could have delivered my son even though i was being abused. get the fuck away from your mother. you know and like a lot of. and and yeah and two open your eyes look what look what's going on. i'm proud of my spirit and my outlook and my my access to what's really going on in the world and my awakeness i'm just proud of me as a person. okay. you're welcome. bye. it's okay it's the old thing yeah it's the old test the other one likes heard of two questions ago.,0,0,5,0.9885621,0.011437823,,,,,462
26,154,okay. hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today. creative. are you okay with this yes. i'm doing good. i'm originally from southern california. i like the downtown theater district i like the beaches i i like the variety of stuff that you can do in one day. well sometimes i don't like the traffic i don't think there's really too much i don't like about la i really like it like that oh. no i haven't really travel in about 5 years. oh i just haven't been able to travel. i just haven't travel. i like going to new places and seeing things i haven't seen before and if i can like visiting places like landmarks. i want to hear that one of your trips. well the last one i did was san francisco that wasn't so far but i got to stay in downtown san francisco and i got to go shopping and i got to get on him the streetcar so that was cool. well i still study i'm studying psychology. well. i decided to go back to school just pretty quickly so i went to junior college and then when it got close to graduate i knew i want to transfer so. i taking a couple psychology course is not decided i liked it so i just decide to make that my major and i thought i didn't have a lot of math but it had enough math. are you happy. well now that i'm almost done i don't know if i'm going to continue in that area. dream job. well would i wanted initially was to get in the sport psychology but i'm not quite sure that's what i want either. okay. you consider yourself more shy or outgoing. well i have to be shy initially but once you get to know me i'm outgoing. what i'm feeling. i turn on the fish tank screensaver i think i either go to sleep eat something really really good or watch something on netflix. like what what does a good movie i like four movies a lot so a lot of right now i'm into martial arts movie with subtitles so. i think i'm pretty good. when was the. you know i know. they're not really long arguments i don't know if there were arguments i know i argue with my boyfriend and he hung up for my face so i don't know why and it got soft pretty quickly so i don't know if it was really that important. when i walked out without saying okay. i can't think of one right now. i think. the hardest decision i probably had to make was moving from will back to california from oregon. can you tell me about that. but i was really young so i was. 19/20 and i was really by myself so that was pretty hard cuz i obviously had to support myself. what made you decide to do that because it was a really really boring in oregon so i really like the activity here in la. what's something you feel guilty about. you know i don't really feel guilty about many things. okay. tell me about your relationship with your family. well i don't talk to them that much my dad and my stepmom live in oregon so i probably talked to on the phone at least once or twice a month and then when i come out here i want to say at least once a year sometimes you can be twice you know occasionally more but not too often and i see them about it but i'm pretty much the only one out here my brother is also up there as well yeah. what have lots of positive influences i think i'm just regular people are come across you know maybe someone off work with maybe i'll actually my uncle he's a really good positive but he knows quite a bit has lots of good advice. like what about life. you know i don't really think i've had anything that bad happen to me where i just don't. what bothers me so much i have to not think about it. well i can't say pretty easy cuz i work schedule and then i go to school but. i want to go to sleep i sleep really well those long as i have enough you know hours. feeling lately really really happy and good. nope. no. always happy hour yesterday. i'm just happy anytime i talk to my boyfriend or if i go out and do something i'm just happy i got off work i'm happy cuz i'm done for the day i'm just really happy i'm on spring break i'm really happy right now so. awesome. something you did read. oh i haven't done like any really extremely fun activities unless you consider going out to eat but the last activity that i had a lot of fun doing with ice skating in december 10th in downtown la. is there anything you regret know i don't really have too many regrets i mean whatever happens happens and you know was meant to play out that way. advice cuz you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago. well. i guess i would say don't worry too much about the small things. even though they seem really big it really they really are insignificant and you won't think about it in 6 months from now. okay. i think my best qualities are i'm a happy person i'm a fun person i'm pretty easy to get along with i think most people like me and i'm just a cool person. well i wish i could study more i wish i would study more i wish that i would exercise more and i wish that i think that's it right there. tell me about. i don't think i want to talk about that. okay.

28,168,hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today. created to talk to people in space. and please. are you okay with this. yeah. how are you doing today. i'm okay. burbank california. yeah. the weather of course i think everyone likes the weather. it's not too. city like chicago or new york it's a big enough we have beaches we're not landlocked. sometimes the smog the traffic the fact that i've just been here like my entire life almost. okay. i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer. do you travel a lot. not enough as i'd like to i go to school in chicago and i've been to new york a couple times san francisco and i took a road trip across the country that was cool i saw a couple states. what do you enjoy about traveling. see new places. going to landmark that i've only. read about er theme pictures of. i traveled from los angeles to chicago taking route 66 and the best part was seeing the grand canyon for the first time it was. the coolest thing i've ever seen probably. happy. and then happy was as beautiful it was nice. i haven't felt like that in a long time. i'm studying film. it's just. something i've always loved for as long as i could remember and when it came time to start applying to schools i wasn't sure what i wanted to do and i apply to northwestern as a film student and it just ended up being the right decision. dream job. i love making movies but part of me really loves making people laugh and being in front of the camera so. comedian i'm coming a comedic actor would be totally great but. you consider yourself more shy or. i am super outgoing and i love talking to people a lot i like i like being the center of attention usually. hey. but it's the best i've got. i. i like to watch mindless television like toddlers & tiaras and duck dynasty just tv programs were really don't have to pay attention at all. okay. how are you at controlling your temper. i'm okay at it i get really emotional really fast but i am usually able to use to keep my anger down and not like lash out at others and stuff for the most part. sometimes i get into like arguments and fights with my friends and people who are important to me really easily. and i hate apologizing to people so besides could last pretty long. my best friend ryan i think. and it was about. our relationship and just how we kind of messed it up and cross some lines and. where how we were going to go back to the way it was before. how hard is that. really hard it's he's my best friend and i miss him. but we messed up and this is just not the same. it's like not the same friendship. me too. too many. i guess. when i have a boyfriend and he has a girlfriend because not okay i wish i would have just. realize that this was bad and just would have stopped there and not have let it continue 4 weeks which led to my break up and then our friendship being really messed up. i guess not spend as much time with him as i did. be more assertive. i guess. it was. in november. i was very depressed and suicidal. so i told my friend what i was feeling and that she needed to take me to the er. and from the er i have the choice to. i don't know i guess go home or get sent to a mental hospital. and even though i felt like i didn't have a choice i knew it was my choice and i decided to go to the mental hospital which is like the worst experience of my life ever. it was awful it was in chicago and. it was scary and i didn't know anyone and they just like take all your stuff and they put you in some scrubs and they just. start giving you medication and you're basically left to your own devices they were only like three group therapy sessions a day and everyone there was mostly men and they were all really old and it was scary i didn't know anyone everyone most of the people there weren't depressed they were violent so that was pretty scary and i just dumb it was really hard for me. i had been so depressed for like a month i stopped going to my classes and work and i told my teachers lies about being sick and i just kept calling in sick to work i dropped a class and i was failing my classes and not turned in any work and i wasn't talking to any of my friends and i was drinking a lot and passing out and vomiting everywhere and. i was just in a really bad place and when i finally was going to kill myself i realized i needed help. it was. i had severe depression when i was a younger teenager and i tried to kill myself then and i got put in therapy for quite some time so i figured i don't want to go down that bad path again i just want to get better. so i had to do it i had to get help. i do i go once a week. i feel like if you have the right therapist it's really useful. i had one therapist that i really liked and i thought we could have gone really far but sadly she's back in chicago and i'm in los angeles so i have to. have to make do with this new therapist and she's okay. just not we're not that great together but she's who i have right now. better than nothing. not that easy at all. ever since i got out of the hospital and start a night began medication for my depression. just haven't been able to sleep well falling asleep is hard staying asleep is hired have really crazy vivid dreams that wake me up in are disturbing. like what. i guess just. sometimes they reflect things that i'm worried about are happening in my life but they're just. the scary and they seem so real that sometimes i wake up and i have to ask my mom like did we go here to be do this to this really happen and it's usually know you dreamed that sometimes i've gotten so scared i like talk in my sleep and wake myself up. probably like two nights ago. wow. tell me about the last time you felt really happy. that is a. hard question. i think. and november. after i got out of the hospital. i finally had one good day and my friend took me into downtown chicago and we went to the sears tower and got to look over those like big windows that you walk out on and see the city and that was with the cool. how your best friend. probably. super outgoing likes to be the center of attention funny and a little bit crazy. i try not to regret things in my life. i would say that living is worth it and just don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it don't wait until it gets really bad. i guess my ideal weekend would be sleeping in and then catching a movie with my friends may be going home with them and bake some cookies eat all the cookies watch some tv have a sleepover and then like make pancakes in the morning and watch more movies we watch a lot of movies i would like to do my free time. go for a walk i don't know go to the beach. that is a hard question i mean i think i've done a lot of great things in my life. and i have achieved a lot but. i think one of the proudest things badass moments in my life is something really small and insignificant i was doing this exercise boot camp and. the last persons like cross the finish line had to do like. 30 pushups and it was some guy i didn't really know him at all and the trainer said does anyone want to help him if he's going to help them you have to do half each and no one wanted to help him and then i just decided to start doing push ups with him and i just. it wasn't cuz i wanted to get creditor because i thought it would make me look good i just did it and no one really knows about that but it's just i feel really good about that. is my buy. press the button.,1,1,5,0.05361053,0.9463895,,,,,414
29,170,i am so i'm going to bring up the virginia 1%. and then bring it back down to thursday. so you're going to see. it can only end. ask questions you can answer ray. and you respond like she should say goodbye but it's right and reason she stopped. glitch glitch. like a computer glitch or something. okay. yep yes. okay. pretty good pretty good i had a good morning a good productive day did some work with the some kids at a basketball camp so. new york. well. what i like about. what do i know about traveling. meeting new people kind of having that experience of. being in the moment all the time because everything is so new. and. just kind of getting my. my routine shaken up a little bit temporarily. my trips are probably. that's one baby was when i went to costa rica. if i got like seven or eight other friends and then. four of us went on to go to guatemala and i'm sorry. panama to an island off panama and you're just amazing just total new world new totally new cultures off the beaten path it was nothing i never seen before so. open up my eyes to. the world lolbit. probably. i studied. theater and politics and music. right now i am deciding or figuring out if i'm going to be. doing basketball as a career or if i'm going to be doing it networking type stuff as a career. kind of depends probably. probably 65% sure i'm 35% alcohol. i. and i think i just like to kind of take. take things slow and get to know someone a little bit first before i open up to them but sometimes i'm just in a real gregarious mood it just kind of floats out of me and i'm just like talking everyone but usually i kind of hang back a little bit and. get a feel for the person before i open up to them. all meditate now it's been so helpful. play hoops i write a. journal. and i talked to someone that and i care about let him know that i love him. probably too good. i think i keep. things inside maybe sometimes i'm free pretty patient i kind of. put it all on my shoulders and. well ya know once or twice. things built up and i didn't express them. so it eventually led to like erratic behavior because it kind of came out in like spurts are like bursts. and a bunch of stuff is like unleashed it once. instead of you know normally something happens it gets released when this case. something got released it was like a hundred things got released at 1 cuz it all been saved up. the last time i argue with someone. probably with. when i. broke up with my girlfriend before i. was. deployed overseas. yeah i didn't. back the way i handle that. i kind of just laughed and pretending not to care anymore. she didn't deserve that her family didn't deserve that. it's been pretty good to me. starcycle erase. yes. 18. because i am i want to serve my country i was born in new york and new york was hit the timer 11th and i was 17. and i. do i want to go to college so why not. termite country. yes all in all yes it was tough it was tough but. and you are. i needed to get that dose of reality. kind of a pretty drastic change from make a wish there had been more of a gradual increase in the intensity of experience. i got a little overwhelmed at times but. made me stronger in the end. yes. acme. you know that's a lie like a few maybe 5 or 7 years to completely kind of a simile my experience but only like me in the first 6 months after. i got out of the army was a little strained i kind of just. did nothing cuz i don't even so structure for so long and i was just like. i'm living on my own schedule not doing anything yeah and then. you know i was coming sometime after that just to kind of figure out what i wanted to do in life. i went back to school or went went went to college for the first time started playing basketball game for college and. if we kept that up last couple years i just started. coaching basketball in. doing some computer training learning networks do networking. and it's right now i'm right now i'm writing a book on. what i've learned. aurora. really good really. really free like i'm creating my own future now for the first time. and a long long time. yeah yeah. it's been a little bit. what's the word like i knew on the edge. no not not like. since. i'm the biggest thing i change my behavior was signed to meditate. for sure so did that for the first time by 3 years ago. and. that. the pretty much brought me back to myself i kind of like you know what i consider to be like my true self. so that doesn't change my behavior has now i'm acting more from. my heart instead of like reacting to like my thoughts about to pass the future. nine times outta ten. ashley pretty great. when i don't sleep well it's pretty clear i'm pretty i'm pretty quiet i kind of keep to myself. i don't have that like sparkle i don't have that like. valakut attack energy know that energy to go out and get go out and get it right now. little bit tired didn't sleep that great last night. so they went to bed late and i'm going to go to bed like 9:10 last night i went to bed at like 1 and i'm helping a friend move. so yeah today i'm feeling i'm a little bit like black. no. not really. no i never been diagnosed i went to a. where. you know the first two or three years after i was in the army and i kind of wanted life to be the way it was before i joined the army things i think there wasn't a lot simpler than to me and a lot more manageable and then i got hurt while playing basketball. and you know so i couldn't like play hoops for a while for like 2 years and i'd say like i was pretty. i was pretty down during that.. but. i was thinking as i was always. i had one foot in the down the down zone but my other foot was in like how do i get myself out of this predicament i never liked gave up hope. flashes like fossil flash like. every everyone long once in awhile recite what's the point you know like and then just died at the end anyways so why so why fight you know why struggle. but. in general live 99.999% of the time. got it got it just going to go deep inside and find out what the right thing to do is and then do it the best i can. well i was i mean. i was pretty happy last night when i saw my girlfriend and i got to like spend quality time with her and just kind of like give her love and like not make it all about swing physical and i was pretty happy when i first got into la so we could go and i made it to venice and i was playing hoops and sunny as beautiful and i was free at my car. hey no agenda at money in the bank. probably. i know by when i went on that trip to. well. person moments 2 years ago me and my brother and my sister went on a trip together dominican republic. that was awesome. definitely definitely of the girl that was my. my first love like she was a great person. to really really good heart. and. i kind of. my best friend probably thinks that like you know i'm. miss like funny cool guy. that's like going to be a movie star someday or something. they take everyone on like trips in like. just like make everything fun for everyone else. playing basketball in venice beach. smite. to my it's either my phone or i may just be the first to tie for first. place to pay to play basketball in the hole that i ever played. and now is. play yesterday against a bunch of guys. and it was just great it was just magical it's i love i love to be i love the people i love the the craziness that comes through their people on bikes with boom boxes be inclined to the people freaking just stuff in the background on the boardwalk. you know running around make things interesting.

30,178,"thank you. at the door. hi i'm ellie. are you okay with this yes. how are you doing today i'm doing really good. i'm from granada hills california it's the san fernando valley part of los angeles. i love the weather i like the diversity in people i like how you can go to a neighborhood and it's not just one racer kind of food i love the beaches all the activities you could go do the theme parks aquarium stuff like that museums. this smog. there's a lot of creepy guys. i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i have not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot i've pretty much child around la i've been cross-country and back three times twice with when i was 17. what do you enjoy about. i like meeting new people and trying different foods and seeing how other people live. i want to hear. when i was seventeen i ran away with my boyfriend to upstate new york to watertown it was a like a navy army kind of town we had an apartment there are it snowed a lot we sold antique spirit living. awesome. getting calluses pressed houses for the sunset strip music festival through friend and getting to meet rock stars and hang out i like the private parties. i'm very outgoing i love people. sometimes when i'm feeling. what is the fastest guy. what do you do. am i go to the gym and work out quite a bit i find it helps relieve stress and keeps my energy level going i really notice if i don't work out a couple of days i feel a little more tired than normal and is it helps me feel good. i'm pretty good at it i'm very, i worked a lot of events and jobs where you're dealing with like thousands of people a day and people you need to talk to you and you have to remain calm and you know they're the customer so you have to make them feel wanted and good and realize that you're getting paid cuz the money they're spending so i'm good at resume resolving like consumer complex and stuff on the job. i had a drunk friend that was just falling around and yelling and saying rude things to people and i kind of started getting loud like just telling her to stop doing that i didn't know that she was embarrassing and what she was saying to people was very mean and you know and i wonder like if you're talking to people like that they might not like it and they could attack you or something you know you never know it is la. what's something you feel guilty about. i really don't feel guilty about anyting decisions i've made in my life i think i've made really good decisions and i always stick with my moral compass what i'm doing i grew up in church so i haven't gone in years but i still have those values and you know the rules the ten commandments and stuff in my head. i had a slumlord landlord and i wish that i called you know the proper authorities and follow through on a court case instead of letting him like kind of bully me out because it wasn't up to code. a few years back i was dating a guy and he wanted me to move back to where he was from and after a few months you know he was coming early and going back home i decided to move there and i had just started you know this business is doing event planning was picking up and i decided to leave there and try to do it there and you know on the east coast and it didn't work out but it was tough deciding like should i leave la and make this jump and try something new and experienced something new or stay and what i was doing. i was i had a degree in dental assisting i did that for like a year i didn't like it and then i was sending communications like radio and television broadcasting and journalism. i'm somewhere i'm doing a van work and i wrote for a magazine a couple years and i'm trying to like get a website going and then have like where i'm controlling my own riding and what's going on instead of writing for someone else. i always wanted to ride and was always into the news and music and art growing up i really like connie chung she was like a channel 4 newscaster in the eighties and i love barbara walters. i was a nerd. relationship with your. tell my sister she doesn't talk to any of the family and i have a good relationship with my mom i never really knew my dad it doesn't bother me. i have cousins and stuff but everyone's scattered across the country so i don't really talk to them and phone we just communicate on facebook or like twitter. how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep so i go right to sleep when i get tired i just go to sleep. how you been doing lately three good energetic i've been motivated to go look for more van work you know event planning stuff and really grinding in more than i was. i mean it's kind of hard cuz you got to talk to people and get them to trust you and see that you could plan events and meet people and convince them why they should pay you to do their event than someone else. i mean i'm generally pretty happy unless something devastating happens like someone gets cancer the one i know dies. i want to say that i'm just super like oh my god happy all the time but it's like an even keel that i feel pretty good all the time. i'm very talkative and friendly and i could approach strangers and talk to them eddie's and i could adapt to different situations and even if it's not my scene or situation or group of people that i'm used to i could still jump in talk to people and be comfortable and make friends and adopt. what are some things you wish you could change about you. i want to make more money. i'm over in like second grade the people used to make fun of me cuz i was very tall and skinny and i had like straight a's were in the highest grades and lacrosse so people would make fun of me and call me giraffe. stuff like that. very talkative she would just say that i talked to everyone. and i'm very friendly and if you need help that i'll help someone you know. a recently i went up to oceanside and visited a friend i've known years and we just went out for burgers and hang out on the beach and we got her two-year-old son and like chicken in the park and played and it was really nice and they was cool visiting or i didn't seen her in six months and it was really fun and i want to go again and. i like the area. i guess maybe i could be trying to find my own work more like for my business instead of working for other people. i think i pursue it but i think maybe i could put a little more time and day into it. tell me about nevada or something that you wish you could erase her memory. i don't really know anything like. that we want a raise or not happen. okay. is there anything you regret. no i feel good about my choices i made and i think i'm on the right path and a lot of things i wanted to do than balls rolling and i'm you know getting things done i'm not as big as i want to be but i feel like i'm on my way there. advice would you give yourself 10 or 20. i'm like 10 years ago i would have told myself to work more in the daytime instead of going out as much as i was. my friend we call mojo. mojo has a magazine and i just wrote years and he really pushes me to like keep riding and keep doing the vance and keep on the ball i'm rolling and he's one of the biggest people you know my life tummy you're talented you could do it you know he's just a really good like motivation for me. you know being published i've been on tv shows and just getting my own event thing going and. i have a lot of people who read what i ride everyday and follow-on i just think it's a you know it's not exactly honey where i want to be but it's great start. and i work to get to that point. great

31,179,never had that doesn't matter okay. start a conversation. okay. go back over here. when she said she'll let you know. hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. and please. are you okay. sure. i'm doing good how are you. chicago. yeah. about 25 years ago. yeah it's been a while. actually haven't been back i like ally i like la. it's a big city so it's kind of similar but the weather is not the same so got to let la for the weather. family i was a child. you took a little adjustment but not hard. the weather can't think of anything right off the bat but i sure wouldn't want to leave so my family is here so that's another reason why i wouldn't want to leave. traffic. not really but i've tried to shove a little bit yeah. seeing new places different people the way they live their lives. my went to monterey california earlier the middle of last year that was very nice. it's a good question i'm not really sure. probably. i can't think of anything right off the bat which makes me think it's kind of weird but. astronomy. yeah it was. i don't know just kind of fell into it took a course liked it and then took some more and i just went down that path. no. there is not much job opportunities. it's kind of limited. yeah it does. my dream job i would like to own a restaurant a nice butt bar restaurant. can you tell me about. i'd like to have something a little more upscale than most places you go to released in the area that i live in most places don't seem very kind of just seem like a dive bar just kind of worn out run down so something nice something different something creative something vibrant something for you know tracks of crowd. but it's probably cost lisa i don't know if it's really possible. i'm definitely more shy but i can be outgoing when i'm comfortable with people that initially i'm pretty shy. good idea. a lot of times i try to just lay back and you know do some deep breathing just kind of clear your mind or maybe just watch a movie listening to music is good reading a book that is just takes your mind away relax. i've gotten much better at it i used to have problems with that when i was younger but i'm good i'm good with that now learned that you shouldn't react immediately to situations you should you think before you speak that type of thing. when was the. my ex girlfriend when we broke up about 3 months ago. we're relationship just wasn't doing very well so it just kind of was going down a predictable path and we just were arguing over the same old stuff and wasn't really it wasn't a memorable argument that it was it was an argument so that's all i can think of and i haven't really seen her since so that's what it is nothing special just a typical argument between two people who drowned separate. frustrated. like i guess everybody kind of sees things in their own way and do you know my way in my perspective is right and i'm sure her way was right too so trying to convince somebody that you love your ideas or what you're thinking is more difficult than it is because everybody's kind of looking out for themselves. oh yeah. that's a good example right there with the with my girlfriend i didn't have to i could have reacted a little differently and not shown so much emotion there's been times in my life where i got into arguments with friends or something like that were you know or previous relationships where i probably shouldn't have reacted the way i did you know not that i did anything bad but just more of a you know be more mature about not you know reveal your emotions so much for that type of thing. tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had. leaving my first girlfriend to go to school when i was 18 is it a long time ago. i went to school in san diego and i immediately wanted to come back so. i kind of ruined our relationship and we're still friends and i wish i didn't do that. what's something you feel guilty about. i feel like i can contribute more to my family and my friends like i think i could do better i think i sell myself short so. employment opportunities are hard to come by but if i can find a good job and be a lot more happy because i can provide for myself and others so not be so much of a burden to people around me. yeah real difficult. tell me about your relationship with. good very good we're pretty open with each other and i see my mom and dad and my sister quite often so it's good relation i mean we get along very well could be demi is not perfect but it's good. pretty easy i'm a good sleeper. i'm probably irritable or harder to do tasks it's kind of like you feel like you're being strained or something because you don't have as much energy and. how did the feeling lately good relatively well spring time always makes everybody feel well. have you ever been tag guns with p. no not at all. never. really really heavy and you we all feel happy everyday at some point but really happy probably been a while. if i like super bowl sunday i was with all my friends were having a good time so it's been probably like a month and a half or something when i was really really happy. i wish i was more. i guess. stuff to my goals and i wish i had better drive to succeed i don't know i usually settle for less. i don't know i guess that's the calm demeanor part of me that's good and bad. don't really matter i kind of live in the moment and then you kind of realize that 5-10 years ago on by and should have done something. i'm just going to stick to that argument with my girlfriend three months ago she made me feel pretty bad. tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. i don't know when i was. when i was in high school i got into an argument with a friend and i drove my car too fast and it was an area that i didn't know and i hit a turn that i didn't know i was coming and i crashed my car so i wish i didn't do that but that's a long time ago so it's not a big deal now. stupid immature. my parents some of my close friends i have i have a good group of three or four friends they've been positive influences. caring guy nice person good heart. little little unmotivated needs to improve on certain aspects of his life to. make himself better and passionate i guess passionate in a good amp. i care a lot and it's the same time sometimes it gets the best of me. can you give me the. sometimes you feel like you know you're doing more for your friends or somebody like that. you're doing more than they deserve and you're not it's not being reciprocated. so that's an example. yeah probably but i can't think of anything off the top of my head. focus more in school because while you're young you have the ability to multitask and. something you did recently. i don't know really enjoyed i mean i do things everyday that i enjoy but really enjoyed i don't know. i cleaned up a bunch of stuff in my room so it's nice to shed some old garbage so that that was all right but don't know if i really enjoyed that i feel content after it. what are you most proud of in your life. how much it's makes kind of sad i don't know i think i could do better i feel like i'm underachievers so i don't much i don't know. i'm very detail-oriented organized i like to finish tasks i care a lot and i'm very caring. i have good intentions in mind i don't like the wrong people i don't like to lie because once you buy one lie leads to another so i don't like that. but yeah that's that's about it. cool. right on have a good day. hey those weird i felt like i was in therapy. so take this offer.,0,0,5,0.9874419,0.012558147,,,,,416
32,181,yeah i'm okay with it. i feel pretty good little nervous. because i've never done anything like this before that's why. from ohio cincinnati. two months ago two and a half months. i was just looking for. wanted to be in a new environment. oh yeah i'm ecstatic. very happy. i took a few weeks just to get adjusted. cuz i don't know it. the weather is probably the best thing. yeah i know. been other than that pretty much the same as everywhere else i've been. it's nothing i don't really like about la. since you know the weather is the best part of it. i like to travel somewhat i haven't travelled a lot of my life but over the past year-and-a-half i've done done quite a bit of traveling. seeing different places different people new people new faces. new places. but she lasts will last summer i spent the summer in cleveland doing the urban farming. in the city. i stayed at a hospital the first hospital in cleveland. and i was at doing program with the. and it was basically we would go to different urban farms throughout the city and volunteer. about 20 25 hours a week. oh yeah. really a spur-of-the-moment type of thing. wanted to try something different something i've never done before. and farming is one of those things that you know most people would never try. cuz of a you know cuz of a certain stigma that comes along with it. and you know i just thought it would be fun and interesting to do something like that. what in the urban farming or in general. urban farming. how do i guess. i don't know just just the overall experience is going you know eating and going to the farmers markets and eating all the fresh food and just send the difference in. you know how fresh natural food tasted you know as opposed to the foodie by the grocery store. yeah it is really this. i was i took two semesters of a college and i was undecided so i was just taking general classes. my dream job. it's my dream job with the d. anything that involves i don't know how like a specific dream job or anything that involves nature just being outside i would like to i wouldn't mind being like a like a forest ranger or something like that. as long as i have you know yeah. consider myself more shy. don't like don't know why it's just the way it is. i read. listen to music. a draw. watch movies stuff like that. i think i'm pretty good at it. i think yeah. wow. yeah i can't remember the last time i hear argument with someone. i don't know. again i don't know because. i don't. dwell on things that happened in the past. maybe whether or not to come to california i guess that was a hard decision. well. i don't know i've been thinking about it you know moving to a new place for a long time. and i guess. hardest part of the decision was. thinking weather. whether or not i will be secure or not you know what i mean just going to a new place we don't know anyone. kind of. are you really don't know what's going to happen. so. there was a lot of. you know fear not in that decision should i go to a place where i don't know anyone i don't i'm not familiar with the area you know only only perception of a hat that i have of this area's you know what i've seen on it and media media and tv. so you know yeah i guess that was the hardest hardest decision that i can think of. i guess so. nothing absolutely nothing. yeah. nothing. i don't feel guilty about anything. relationship with my family. i'm not really close to my family. i guess the person. i'm closest to as my mom but you know i don't you know i never really talked to her much. i don't really know my dad that well so you know. guess my grandmother. yeah she yes she's. she's very. how should i say it. she's very to the thinker i put it like that like she's very insightful so. you look so her. for a lot of advice because she's been through a lot through a lot in her life. i feel like she you know she's been through a lot so she understands a lot so let you know. she's a very positive influence. very easy. maybe unsure. i would say. because. right now i really don't know. what direction i want to go in with my life. and it's been a lot of confusion with that. but you know it's not. it's not something that overly affects me but you know it's always a thought in the back of my mind felt feels like somehow. maybe i'm running out of time. i know that's not like that's not it that's not a realistic thought because. i don't see how you could ever run out of time but. yeah i guess yeah. just general not knowing what i want. but i know like how do i cope with that. how do i cope with that. i don't know i just do a lot of thinking a lot of soul-searching. it's not hard i mean i mean. it's like i can't say it's hard because it's one of those things that i feel like it's necessary. and. you know certain things in life you just you're forced to face. so it's harder to i think it's harder to avoid those type of things. no. no. no. today. when i talk when i talk to my friend earlier. awesome. how would my best friend describe me. i guess you would say i'm quiet. if you describe me as a nice guy. insightful. goofy. no i don't really think like that. no. 10 or 20 years ago i guess i will tell myself to. stick with whip what stick with what i love. did a. acting workshop. and numb. i don't know if i've always been interested mine. and i decided why not no try it so you like it. what am i most proud of. like an event or an accomplishment. cuz i pride myself on being independent. bye.,0,0,5,0.9773028,0.022697208,,,,,467

people say it's expensive to live here who's probably talk to you. recently i've traveled. well you get to see new places in a new people you get to learn more about other cultures and different ways people think. how at the end of march and went to ecuador for a week. i spent most of most of one day with with an ecuadorian who only speaks spanish and i speak very little spanish so we got it was it was challenging for me trying to communicate with him felt like a little kid trying to narrow saying yo what's this what's this is very humbling. you're just just saying that. and when you don't we're not able to communicate that that can be very difficult. i'm probably more of a shy person. genetics i don't know why. i'm an electrician so i studied electrical construction have also saved a computer networking. it was. i guess just kind of circumstances i needed the work i was doing wasn't providing for the family and i knew someone who could get me a job doing electrical work until so i pursued that because of the financial gain. it's giving me a lot of opportunity. but i don't think it's why i do what i want to do for the rest of my life. well i'm actually pursuing becoming a missionary my wife and i are looking at moving down that corridor in the fall for 4 years and last year we we trained in north carolina for one year and that was like theology and bible training. basically god put a desire in my heart to get beyond could be on myself and and do something for other people to to go in and learn about another people their culture and to share the gospel with them. all my immediate family. i have my mary have been married for 10 years this june and we have four daughters and then but i have one older brother. how no sisters. to what what do you want to know about my family. i'm really close with my wife and my daughters are with my brother i'm not not real close partly because he's at he's mentally handicapped he has the mental capacity of a 7 year old even though he's he's five years older than me so just kind of because of that dynamic it's hard to have a close relationship with him by i'm pretty close with my parents my brother lives with my parents. i tell you my i use fashion high school he was a real real positive influence and me. just he has a. he has a drive in his heel for for pursuing the truth. and just a. studying the bible in and because of his influence that kind of put me on a path to wanting to study the bible. i think i've gotten better at it there have been times when y'all get angry and. yo it can just kind of really rule over me just the frustration and i'm the type of person that takes me usually it takes some time for me to get angry and then some time to to calm down again but i've i've learned over time that really getting angry and keeping that anger and doesn't it doesn't attack the other person or the thing that i'm angry at it just kind of attacks me it's a really it's not a it's not good behavior to to keep so wet when things anger me i tried to like talk to the person saying it was at this situation is making me upset try to can't talk through it and in resolving come to a resolution even more than just compromising but trying to really resolve the root of the problem. well a couple weeks ago or made it as me being a month ago my wife and i were going on a trip with with her parents and her parents had already left it we're just driving down to orange county area for this trip and my wife wanted what she had said expectation of certain things to be done before the trip or certain things we packed and but hadn't really and in my eyes had express that clearly but her eyes she had and so when i was trying to meet those expectations she knew i didn't meet him according to to what she wanted and then she became angry and so from my perspective i was doing what she wanted and kind of getting attacked for it so so that i i started yelling at her and. and we know we have that conflict but then. yeah we're within an hour so we kind of talked through and we had figured out what the the cause of that conflict was. are you asking the moment of during the conflict. very ill just very angry you know you can feel it in your body part part of the anger is play the secondary response but my initial response was that on if it was feeling attacked and that came out as anger so i would think yes or no should i felt attacked and then that resulted in the anger. i guess it was. deciding to go. hum to go toward training last year i felt the guy to put on my heart that this was something i supposed to pursue my wife didn't feel that way and i. i just feel very strongly that that was something that we should pursue and but at the same time i knew that if if my wife wasn't supportive of it that it would kind of fall apart so i kind of relinquished it and i said her you know i'm not going to make you go. your life if you want to go then then we'll go but if not then we'll we'll do something else we'll we'll look at at doing something else and not going so that that was difficult for me cuz you again that i kind of felt like a loss cuz i felt deeply that that's what i was supposed to do but then after i kind of gave that up then then she came to a point where she said no i have a piece about not doing this and i went ahead and pursuit at so so just kind of giving it up what was it was difficult for me. tell you about something bad or something that i can erase my memory. i miss you. not sure. i don't know i can't really think of anything very traumatic that i would want to erase i think you're good things and positive and good things and bad things they all kind of. shape who we are and. so i i can't think of anything that would want to erase. usually usually it's not too bad. are you referring to on the the questionnaire when i said that i had some trouble sleeping. that the job a works at the. kind of the scheduling a shifted so i so lately i've been working some night time shifts or graveyard shifts so coming home in the morning you know when it's light and it's been hard for me to sleep but it was it was mostly cuz i was staying up so late because of work. pretty easy. what i do when i don't sleep that i do get cranky. i've been feeling good lately. no not really. no. no. her--no. can't think of anything that was. cut out of the ordinary but. yesterday we my wife and i took two or three younger girls we took him to the park the oldest one stay with her grandma but we we took him to the park and they played and. yeah so that those are always happy times we take the kids to the park. i think you say i'm a family man sad. i'm a dependable that he can he can count on me usually might my friend i end up doing different work around the house for him cuz i'm kind of a handyman so. so that way i think you say i'm kind of dependable or someone you go to for advice. i guess i would. i guess i would like to be able to start conversations with people easier. sometimes i have trouble just talking to people especially if they're in a group if people are 101 then it's it's usually easier for me to talk to them but kind of talking to people in a group how i wish i was a little better at that. now if it's. okay what was it say right before that was that. if if i'm giving a speech or something to a large group i don't really have a problem with that but if it's more interaction type thing that's kind of call advisor we're going to myself turn 20 years ago i probably would have been to to go to college right away instead of going to school later in life. that's about it. think i'm that would have been the biggest difference in my life i think. what if i have 4 kids and. i hope i'm raising him right i hope that. that alarm for the mistakes that i've made i can kind of guide them through their their journey in life and i hope that they end up a little. better for it then than me. yeah i just hope hope kind of threw them that i can. heal. believe something worthwhile. you're welcome. goodbye. torrid. okay.,0,0,5,0.93432665,0.065673344,,,,,482
34,188,yes. i'm okay. pennsylvania. well i was in boston for a couple years and then i moved here about three and a half years ago but i just wasn't satisfied with call you my life. maybe once or twice last year and got to go back once. a year. definitely safer and definitely amalur why dismiss it cuz i have lost family back there but ellie is okay i mean everyone loves the climate here. not too easy i have two really good friends here and i have a boyfriend i've done with for three years so that helps he's from here but it definitely took a bit of adjustment. no. advertising communications. no i'm currently working and i said i'm not working right now at the moment. i want to be a naturopathic physician. so basically versus western medicine and naturopathic physician is someone who help someone with the symptoms and doesn't just treat the symptoms for threesome as a whole person so they look at nutrition they look a diet exercise just a variety of things to actually get someone to live a healthier life versus medications are things of a commonly prescribed now and western medicine. how did you do. well one of the great things was when i came out here to la i was exposed to the debris which i had never heard of living on the east coast. sometimes. grand very particular about the people i like to surround myself with and i don't like to socialize with a lot of people i mean i tend to like small intimate groups and i don't tend to like to be in larger a bigger groups. when people don't take an account other people's feelings. i usually. try to go for a walk if i get very irritated. i'm usually really good it really takes a lot for me to spill over into gallery become upset. let's see. i was up with my lawyer and it was about his handling of my case. yeah it was he's other and i think they're just a little bit mediocre than not the best lawyers. i have no idea. i'm very trustworthy and loyal. i can't read deeply so i like to try to help other people and i would like to try to cheer people up so i think that's i would be some of them. no. yes. just a few months ago about in the last 6 months. i was experiencing. mental issues that i've never really came across the for paranoia and anxiety and i knew that it wasn't. i knew that it wasn't that i can overcome it by myself. a lot better i've been doing a lot of yoga and meditation kind of seeing things from a different purview or and i never purview but a different view and. that's how but there's definitely times where i kind of thing back into thinking about the event especially because the vet cost me the stop working. i think i cannot have a difficulty being in public i'm still dealing with anxiety and paranoia about that and that's something may happen so so a lot of times during the day is when it happened so i'm not that comfortable going out there in a day at 10 to go out in the mornings and evenings and i don't like to go into places where there's only one way in and one way out. well i've been gradually trying to increase how much i'm outside. and i usually just deep breathing i do a lot of breathing exercises and i just try to stay that basically what i'm thinking or what's going on with me is not real and that. i just i try to try to get myself to go into these places more gradually a lot better since the last couple months but before i very much pretty much stayed home. it's been good it's been good to hear someone's feedback but i feel like i've gotten more help with just my inner talk was just kind of sitting with myself and journaling. i do. well i feel more like myself which is a huge improvement. and i am more. cautious in aerogarden some ways about my thoughts and about my decisions well i'm not so i'm not so you know i'll just do this and not really think of the consequences of other things that i want in my life. how is your day. it's gotten better i'm okay i'm better now the first three months it was very difficult i couldn't sleep through the night and i woke up maybe two or three times and would be away for a couple hours but now i am sleeping through the night again. groggy feel foggy and out of it. and just low kind of depressed. i think it's been awhile. working i've been a workaholic spending time with my family. yeah just being outside enjoying nature reading. i'm very close. what is that. well my parents cuz he's always been very supporting and loving giving me feedback about my decisions or what i'm choosing to do but allowing me to make my own decisions my own choices in life and then my sisters are just always been very you know i just was checking with me i'm the baby i'm the youngest in the family so they always looking out for me and just checking in with me and my boyfriend shoots man with this incident that happened he's been very usually support of what just letting me kind of have my talk and work things out and understanding when i'm feeling and not wanting to go out and publican and being aware of that that is not so easy for me just to do something like grocery shop for. i'm running errands without having a lot of anxiety. i'm most proud of. the jobs the work that i've done the people i've helped. maybe that i took this job where i was assaulted at that would be it going into retail and to unsafe environment not listening to my gut. what advice would i what. to recklessly pursue your dreams that there is no such thing as too late or running out of time and and enjoy every moment of your life not take anything for granted. etsy. well cooking i really

35,189,"i'm going to bring this doorbell over here. thank you. are you okay with this yes. i'm good thank you. i was born in mexico city. yes. i'm about 34 years ago. yeah. i tried to go back once a year but i haven't been in about 3 years. i haven't had the time and i've traveled other places but i'm planning on going back probably next year. okay. how does it compare to la. well i can't ever see myself moving back to mexico city it's a huge huge city and i like la more there's more opportunities and i just feel at home here. my family moved here like i said i was very young and my parents moved to california to work and then we just stayed here. i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i have not much of a world explorer i love traveling i have not traveled as much as i would like to but i do love to travel. just seeing these things meeting people from other countries to stop feeling relaxed and having no worries because you're on vacation i just love being in other places. the last trip i took was a 7-day cruise and it went to st thomas barbados st lucia dean martin and it was amazing i would love to do that trip again. i think going to mexico the last time i was there i went to the pyramids still see what's going on and i had not been there in many years and it just was amazing to see the pyramids and i can't even imagine how they were able to build such great structures. i consider myself more sigh. in social situations i kind of feel uncomfortable i'm not one to just go up to people and start conversations if people come up to me of course i'll talk to them but i feel slightly awkward just kind of out of place at a party. i actually studied history. i've always been interested in history and i just wanted to learn about histories from other cultures and of course us history so i'm very interested history. i'm actually working in the education field. what's your dream job. my dream job would actually be traveling around the world and having a show on like the travel channel that would be my dream job because i would get paid to travel and it's something i enjoy to do doing so i would love to do that as a job. i love reading and i love taking baths so to relax i like to take a bath and i read while i'm in the bath and i also like going to the gym that helps me deal with stress and it actually relaxes me even though i'm exercising. i used to be not very good at controlling it when i was a kid i would get mad very easily and sometimes as an adult i still get angry easily but i've gotten a lot better at trying to think about things first before saying them and not having outbursts things like that. the last time i argued with somebody was probably about a week ago it was my best friend and she actually she has kids lie down and for some reason she thought or thinks that i think i'm a better person than she is and because i went to school and she didn't and she's home with the kids and you know i'm able to do more things i don't think i've ever made her feel that i've been i definitely know i don't feel like i'm better than her but for some reason she accused me of that and we had an argument about it. tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle different. well that's situation i wish i had handled differently because when she was talking to me she was very upset and i started off pretty, i'm just trying to reason with her and let her know that i certainly didn't feel like i was better than her butt towards end of the conversation it just kind of turned into a yelling match between the two of us and i wish i had been able to just stay calm and maybe ask her to call me later when she calm down instead of just continuing the argument. i was angry at first but once we hung up i felt really bad about the situation i felt that maybe i could have just let her let out all her feelings and then try to speak to her calmly instead of yelling at her to. ever had. oh wow. that's a tough one i think. cuz i think one of the hardest decisions i've had to make is breaking up with a boyfriend of 7 years although i knew that it was the right thing to do i was kind of hanging on to the fact that we have been together for so many years and i kind of felt by ending the relationship i would have wasted those last 7 years of my life so is a pretty tough decision to make but i realize that it was the best decision for me at the time and i'm actually glad i did because then i went on to meet my husband. thank you. about me bag or something that you wish you could erase from me. well about i would say maybe. 15 years ago i was hanging out with a couple of friends at a club and they met some guys and they invited us back to their place and i really didn't want to go because i didn't know these people and i mean i knew their names and that's about it but my friends really wanted to go and i wasn't the one driving so i decided to just go along with them and back at their house one of the guys actually pulled me into a room and try i got scared i yelled he tried to choke me and i thought i was going to die right there right there and i was going to kill me but likely one of my friends knocked on the door because she heard me scream and we left so it could have been a worse situation but i still think about it and wish that i could erase it from my mind. it was. we have a pretty good relationship i am close to him i have a sister and a brother my sister is two years younger and my brother is two years older and we got along pretty well my sister and i used to be best friends but then we grew apart and then and now we're actually closer i think than ever and i have a pretty good relationship with my parents my dad still treats me like i'm a little kid sometimes way to annoys me but i think we have a pretty good solid relationship. how easy is it. i usually wake up a few times throughout the night so i think it's rare for me to sleep the whole night through ever and i do feel a little like tired in the morning when i wake up it's hard i'm not a morning person definitely so yeah it's kind of hard to get a good night sleep. i don't know i have a hard time falling asleep and then sometimes i have bad dreams or i need to get up to use the restroom but yeah i don't remember the last time i actually slept the whole night without waking up at least once. emotionally good i'm actually on vacation right now from work so that's really nice physically i feel good i haven't been to the gym in a while so that kind of makes me feel bad cuz i like working out but health-wise i'm good. no. no. it was a lot this past weekend i actually went out of town with my husband we didn't go very far we went to santa barbara but we really enjoyed ourselves we went wine tasting and went to the beach and just had a really good time. how your best friend describe. she would probably describe me as a good caring person patient very shy to place a 2 that i have a hard time saying no to people when they ask me for favors cuz i'm always doing things for other people so yeah that's how i think she would describe me. i wish i was more outgoing i wish that. i what else definitely more outgoing so i could have more friends i don't have a large group of friends because i am very shy i also wish that i could have more patience than i do sometimes i'm very sorry to paisans and i wish i could. find a better job so i could do more traveling. yes i actually took a really long time after high school to go back to school and get my degree and i really wish that i could have you know taking care of it a lot sooner than i did and i also regret spending seven years of my life with my ex-boyfriend. advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago. i would have told myself to stay focused on school that going out and hanging out and just you know going to parties was not as important as i thought it was and that my education should always come first. i'm proud but after so many years of not being in school i was able to go to ucla and get my degree yeah that would be my proudest achievement. okay. thank you. bye.",0,0,5,0.8543297,0.1456703,,,,,419

that. it's just that i had injury drum mic my my ankle because i have anemia and and i got dizzy one night and i fell on my ankle and on my leg and so i'm just waiting for that to really heal but i'm planning on getting back into town this is one of the things i enjoy doing it really relaxes me. i really don't have a temper over the years i've learned how to do how to control that. probably would have been yesterday but there was no argument and what was it about. nothing that i can recall. what's something you feel guilty about. something i feel guilty about. there's nothing right now that i feel guilty about. a situation that i wish i had handled differently. i really can't think of one right now. the hardest decision. be absolutely hardest decision that i ever had to make was when my i have twins twin twin boys are grown now i had twins twin teen teenagers and i had lost my job and we were living in a motel and the rent for the motel was outrageous i couldn't no longer continue to pay the cable the type of money that they wanted so i had to briefly put my son under the and in foster care for 4 for a minute that was the hardest decision i had to make. schizophrenic and he had had he was born with auditory processing deficit which he overcame through training for a speech therapist and and school officials and he also this is he also lost his hair when he was 4 years old but. and then we turned 14 to schizophrenia came up so right now he he's going to supportive living environment is 27 years old he's come to terms with his mental illness and he accepts it now that i had problems in the past because he didn't want to take the medication to give him the medication and he hide it and stick it in his pocket or whatever so but he's come to terms with that and we will all have come to terms with that he's doing he's doing pretty good. that son he's 27 to texas with his wife and he got a promotion to. so now he's in california to buffering california okay so that's a very good about that yeah. well i've grown children are grown children. not it's not hard to be a parent of grown of my grown children okay when they were younger it was difficult times okay difficult. and is this a good time to but yeah there's some difficult times. well the difficult times i really pretty much already alluded to matt was when one of my twins got the diagnosis of schizophrenia can and they were in temporarily and when was in foster care and one was actually in an institution because of the schizophrenia so. and i lost track of the question. the hardest thing about being a parent at this point this point in my life there is nothing hard about it. what's the best thing about being a parent. the best thing about being a parent i don't know i guess it's just to see something that you created and developed into a pretty decent human being you know a person. smsa. oh a lot of ways well actually i didn't have two parents i had a mother and the father was never in my father was never in the home and he lived in another state so i have no contact with him but the things that i do. differently than what my mother did she was a strong disciplinarian both verbally and physically. and she had the tendency to see how group has tendency to be very critical critical and. opinionated and very religious. and swearing. for a look at people who were not that was me as if they were living life wrong because they were not going to church and reading the bible and all that kind of thing. was that the park. the question. i don't get a good night sleep i don't sleep at all unless i take medication and that's that that's all there is to it i don't take medication i don't sleep i'll be up all night i will be up for days if i don't take medication. irritable. i'm tired. well. lately. you know just a little anxious really you know i just recently made a move to a new apartment has a lot of expenses and new experiences and things like that and i will new furniture and leave this and that that you have to get a managed to do all that but the whole thing was kind of stressful. pof. no not ptsd. we are. that was back in i think 2004. because my life has gotten so stressful to the point where it was either i had to do something or or in something to tell you the truth. yes. yeah i think it's useful you know what's a good sounding board you know someone to throw you know your concerns out and we'll discuss things that may be bothering you are good things to eat with medication. cuz i've been going to therapy the changes a lot of changes i've been more focused. more. hopeful. it is just been a good experience for me which is why i've been saying to go. really happy. well i can feel really happy by some currents i can't think of anything right now just like that and then i go back to how i was feeling so i can't really pinpoint anything really i mean. i mean something comes to me unexpectedly or things go right for a change and continue to go right as opposed to things going wrong all the time. that makes me happy when things go right how about that. something i did recently. but i really. can i live with somebody that i really enjoyed being really really enjoyed. recently. i can't think of anything. i don't have a best friend. my best qualities or that. i'm an honest person. i genuinely give people the benefit of the doubt everyone in my book. is as they appear to be until they prove prove it differently very generous overly generous. and i'm very i like to help other people i mean help them come on a personal level and help people problem is it gives me pleasure to do something for somebody that's helping their mouth. anything i regret. how so. it's only one thing i regret and that is sad. after my twins that became old enough to start going to school at the elementary school level. i was taking some courses as a pre-law major and. at the time i was married to their father turned out not to be a good. fit for me and. because of the stresses involved with him. well knowing that that was running and i was going to leave him i dropped out of college. that was my biggest regret. stay in school no matter what stay the course no matter what. but i'm a good person. i'm a good human being. fo. okay. goodbye. that's going to go go by are you done. okay. i was weird. i was a little weird i was a little nervous.,1,1,5,0.1467601,0.85323995,,,,,418
39,210,and i want to start up the virtual human to chat with you for a bit and when she said she'll let you know i'll put the. okay. yes. i'm okay. i was born in san bernardino california. yes. i'm staying with her sister in north hollywood. she makes it as comfortable as possible. oh i love the weather. and the entertainment and the public transportation. it's very difficult to find full-time employment. and some of the people aren't as friendly as people from the south cuz i lived in the south before. knossos only two things. no i don't. i was an english major in college. i haven't finished yes i am. i'd like to be a recording singer. yes. i've always loved to sing from the time that i was a child. at times. tell me about. when i'm alone i am extremely. i guess i would say. intermind it like i have a lot of thoughts and i keep them to myself. so. if i'm in that mode then i don't really interact with people but i can also in a wreck with people if i change modes. i've just started doing yoga a couple of weeks ago. and. last week on thursday no on tuesday. usually i. just try to remain quiet and listen to the situation if it's a person or if it's a situation that i'm dealing with myself that's annoying i try to think of alternate ways that would make the situation better. come up with alternate plans so i won't be annoyed. pretty good. i may have had an argument a few weeks ago just about timeliness like meeting on time and showing up on time and it was actually last monday. no. to just be cautious of people's intentions. then to listen really well cuz people usually tell you what their intentions are without even realizing it. i'm a good listener patient fun-loving. generous. depressed sometimes. but generally a good person. no i have not. yes. found within a year-and-a-half ago. i just knew that. i often thought about situations that happened in the past and. kind of blame the situation for my future and all. certain settings. i'm if i see certain types of individuals and certain settings it just reminds me of when i was younger when things happened and changed my future plans so i tried it i used to just try to avoid those types of situations and certain types of people at that time but now i feel like i just handled things better as far as. being in the similar settings with similar people i just handled those things better. i do. i'd like to believe that it does. i don't worry as much. it's just allow me to know that actually speaking about the issues. release me of the tension of holding them inside so. that's how it's helped me. at first it was difficult just being open with my internal emotions but now it. it actually is good because i know that when things are occurring if i'm able to communicate about them with a certain individual it relieves me of the stress of of a trying to figure out everything alone and oftentimes by speaking about the issues it allows me to come up with an alternative plan that may be better just because i'm hearing myself speak up the issue. i was diagnosed with depression and my doctor felt that i should probably see the therapist. i am. it depends if i'm really busy during the week and have a lot of things to do i often try to plan things and if i'm planning things it affect my sleep i might wake up in the middle of the night so. sometimes it's easy and sometimes it isn't. irritable. just very irritable. i was feeling anxious but now i'm calmer. today i don't but i have in the past week. because i was in the midst of searching for a stable place to live and it was just taking so long to find a stable place to live so i was becoming anxious. thank you. yes. maybe in october. when my mother first came and she came to visit me in october and when she first got here we had a good time the first couple of days so i was happy to see her i hadn't seen her in over a year. i'm proud that i'm able to adjust to different situations the older i've gotten the more adapt the bowl i am in different environments in different situations and learned how to be more resourceful so i'm proud of that. i'm sorry. my dad my sister she's positive cuz she's finished her master's degree. my mom sometime my best friend is very positive cuz she just started her new business two years ago and she's very enthusiastic about it that's an inspiration. when someone lies consistently. i listened very very well sometimes i give good advice i'm a good friend i normally do the things that i say i'm going to do so i'm dependable my communicate well and. i enjoy people's company most of the time especially if they're in good moods. being around positive people music foot me in a good mood comedy shows put me in a good mood good food puts me in a good mood. when i graduated from high school. it was a really good i'll never forget it was wonderful day. very confident accomplished and i was extremely optimistic and hopeful for the future. you're welcome.,1,1,5,0.065259896,0.93474007,,,,,339
40,212,okay. all right. how about what she's at okay. thank you. yes. okay. connecticut. to be an actor. well i moved to san francisco in 94 and then i moved to atlanta in 96 and then i moved out here to be an actor and i became a realtor instead. i'm to be on a tv show actor. it's pretty hard to get discovered and. you have to be lucky and you have to know the right people and you have to be talented. that really no i don't travel that much i used to move every couple of years to a different city and then i've been here for a while so i don't travel. the weather there's always something to do and. that's pretty much it. the people here tend to be a little more rude and it's just always a fast pace. but when i moved here i was 25 so it was a lot more fun because when you're young in the city you can have a lot of fun and then i got into the real estate and did really well for a while and then the market crashed and so now i'm old and i'm not making any money so times are tough. no no i'm not much of a more of an extrovert. when i don't get what i want and rude people and. just inconsiderate people. i'm pretty good at controlling my temper when i'm not like if i if i drink alcohol it'll make my temper go worse but when i don't drink i'm pretty good at controlling my temper. the last time i argued with somebody was. somebody that owes me money. i live in west hollywood. no no no i live alone i have a dog. it's good i mean i don't like my neighbors i hate my neighbors but the ones upstairs just moved out so that's good news hopefully the ones that move in or not that noisy and the ones below i just can't stand because they argue with. why because they cuz my hardwood floors they say that i've been there for 10 years and they still argue about the noise of me walking on my hardwood floors. yeah. what was the question. my mother has been a very positive influence she's always kept me on track she lived with me for the last 10 years until she recently moved to rhode island to live with my brother. very close to my mother not so close with my brother were close but we're not like close close so i mean we love each other we just don't really understand each other all the time. outgoing life of the party. ambitious. and sometimes cut throat. hum. do you always able to get through the things i need to get through to get to where i want to be. i'm generous i'm loyal i'm friendly i'm accommodating and. that's about it. no. yes. about 4 years ago. well i had was beating up and i had identity theft and you know i was just afraid to go out so i needed to get over that so after spending one year in in my home without leaving that just depressed all the time i i said i have to get out and start talking to people and so i did. thank you. i'm okay i'm panicking about the job situation you know cuz my bills are pretty high and i don't really have a steady income right now. so that's what's worrying me the most is my financial situation. yeah i mean. well basically it's like i just recently quit drinking altogether so i don't drink anymore so i'm noticing yeah i mean it's good cuz the number one i don't have the money and number two i don't like the way i act when i drink i'm so so that's a positive thing but will the when i was drinking and help me just forget and numb myself now i have to feel through the feelings which is pretty good cuz i can talk my way through them so i guess i'm evolving. oh yeah long time ago you know i've taken many medications here and there and they really some of them would numb me some of them would make me feel hyper so i've recently decided in the last 6 months 3 to 6 months just to not take anything so i don't take anything i barely even take an aspirin. to get my body to a to get my body to a normal state. not really. always worrying just a lot of worrying always worrying worrying worrying about everything oh what happens if i get in a car accident what happens if i can't pay my mortgage what happens if i eat just so many things i worry about and that's what was making me depressed. i do at some point i've had some good therapist and i've had some bad therapist i tend to like the ones that talk back to me and kind of give me some guidance as opposed to the ones that just listen and then they just say okay your time is up so and just prescribed me medication so i think i'd be better with a psychiatrist psychologist as opposed to a psychiatrist. well i'm not going to therapy now but. the therapy that i had before i was more like people trying to just come in and check in and give me medication i have had other therapy where i was back in the forest like okay well this is what i think about this and you think about this and that kind of therapy is better. i just i wasn't getting the right therapist recently so and i knew that the root of my problem was the drinking cuz it's a depressant so. stopping the drinking is definitely made me have a much clearer mind and just a work through things myself you know. i can't really think of anything right now. it's been a long time i can't really think about a time when i felt really happy. okay when i was a kid i had a little dog and this big dog came in and attacked and killed it so then a little while later my father. came and he says to my brother and me we were kids go to the car there's two packages in the car so go get them so i was like yeah yeah yeah cuz i never listen to my parents like a spoiled brat to go to the car what's up. he said go to the car and get this out of the car so i finally went when i open the door there was a new dog and a bag of dog food so that's one of my memorable experience. yeah cuz i'm an animal lover so. just the way that i've treated people before when i was hurting i was really mean or rude to people but i felt like you know i was hurting i had to hurt everybody around me so ever since i stopped drinking i don't do that anymore so i'm. so i think the problem is is the drinking and so now that i've let that go cuz i was doing it for the wrong reasons you know i was doing it to them not feel i wasn't doing it to be sociable. getting a career that is really stable like you know like a doctor or a nurse or an attorney something that you know or in advertising i should have gone into that a sales position is it could be very well and very good or very bad so you always have to be on it and sales you can make a ton of money in sales but when you make your money save your money don't go spend it on extravagant things. what i have a job when i when i'm able to work when i'm helping other people. what other people around me are happy and laughing when i can make people laugh that that puts me in a good mood. okay thank you. you're welcome thank you. okay is this modeled after a real person or is it just like they just.,0,1,5,0.3962805,0.60371953,,,,,331

pants instead of blue but i might get some more blue than red. yeah thanks i've been here for like 10 years yeah and i asked i saw it a virgin megastore in hollywood years ago it was the last one and at the time i had a jacket that i got to customize for these so i get away jacket and i'm like what i need to do something with the shoes or just kind of sitting there so. but thank you. brachio. 7 * 3. okay. so she's confusing questions and when she's. okay. she looks so real that's cool. but it's. okay. gotcha. thank you. yes. i'm doing pretty good happy content. not stressed out so good. a los angeles california born and raised. well besides me and my home i love that there is so many various things to do i don't believe you can live here and be bored if you are active person like myself. that is so overcrowded it's just too many people here people are not more hospitable i mean if you speak to someone i feel like i should speak back and i look at you like they want to do something to you or just wake up so angry i don't like a lot of our political laws or issues that we have here and the economy. you travel. not as much as i would like to but yes i do. i enjoy the whole set up the whole agenda the planning the research and i find that very exciting for me i like exploring new places i never been a going back somewhere i really love that just the thought of how much i'm going to put a sign for shopping also don't return wars and picture taking doing videos and is creating a new experience that i had never had before. sure i recently just came back from san francisco i've been there before but i was in one particular part of the castro district and i explored other parts of san francisco is one of my favorite places to go in the first place i decide to go besides putting down my luggage at a hotel would be a restaurant called scoma's which is actually on the pier and they have the best crab cakes ever and the last time i went i saw jerry springer the show you no talk show host i did some shopping i actually met up with friends or some bars actually went i'm a foodie so i went to a couple of restaurants or heard about on the food network i took a boat ride and i've visited some friends so i really had a good time. i have several of those but one of my most memorable experiences in life would be. the day that. barack obama became president that was a memorable experience for me and i wish that a lot of my family members who have passed on was here to see that. that would always stay with me like a tattoo is a very memorable moment that they'll never be forgetting it'll go down in history and it is history and it's just a great experience for me and other people like myself to know that we have transition beyond race and that will in some ways and that you know anyone can become president and really fulfill their dreams. there's no limits. world depends on. okay i am a dispatch manager the last school i attended with. and i have my degree in homeland security and investigations i work for a private security firm i'm actually over seeing about 12 to 20 people a day i worked various hours and my job is very tedious i do a lot of problem solving and it makes the night go by fast i work from 10:30 to 6:30 and within the dispatch center i should say a command center that i oversee we do dispatch and also surveillance so half of the night we're looking at 20 cameras for corporate and residential account also dealing with supervisors and security officers who actually are at a site and we put them in with carter mobile vehicle or mobile van where they stay on site until the actual site is ready and develop for people to come through after construction so we make sure that we obtain and make sure these places are very. well-rounded with security we do a lot of observing and report so any information anything that's happening on site for the the security officers they allow us to know about it i do everything from inventory to attendants talking to other locations out-of-state making sure are a data information in their systems are updated a computer software so anything you think about i'm actually involved in when it's far as the company is concerned so it's very tedious but very rewarding position. my dream job is completely opposite from what i have now i've been writing some 36 i've been writing songs since i was about nine years old and started when i was in the junior choir at church and i've always had a passion for that i feel like that runs through my bloodstream music is is there's a song i would always say for every situation and occasion and i feel like music watch through my bloodstream is just a part of my dna and who i am and my dream job would be an engineer who owns their own record label and a very big time songwriting / producer. oh i'm definitely not shy that's not me at all i'm very expressive person as you can probably hear i've never been shy a day in my life but i'm more outgoing more blunt i would say. that's just who i am i just feel like you know it's people we're all you know made up of different characteristics and personality traits and i just like expressing myself i talk a lot i get that from my father and i just you know what i what i feel i feel like i should put out there and voice my opinion like anyone else that's just who i am. interesting. that's a good question i listen to music but i like to go to the beach and taking the whole scenery just to smell the ocean you know water you know that that whole experience of my feet in the sand looking around just taking in the small things just you know i appreciate them breeze i do stuff like that when i get a chance to but sometimes a glass of wine or just watching tv be having a conversation sometime praying that you know or whatever about anything that goes on with my family so it's different things i do and shopping always helps to his very therapeutic for me. that's number one i would say. pretty good i would say a my twenties i would have a different answer for you i was more quick-tempered i'm pretty good with that yes i do get upset and angry about things depends on what it is but i just think what when you grow and you become you know you know you get older you know not always maturity doesn't always come with age and knowledge and i feel like as i've grown as a person i'm a lot older now more calm and more centered about things so i don't get is at angry as i used to it is a better way to deal with things besides getting angry. a couple of days ago and i argue with my ex girlfriend over the state of things in our past relationship that still bothers us both and we're just trying to get to the point where we can communicate better we say things when we're angry we're still heard about things we're trying to work through so that was the last argument i had. there's so many of those i wish i would have handled. a lot differently. wow so many of those situations i wish i would have handled differently. good question i'm sorry for taking so long it's just so many things i i think about. wow. handled differently. i don't know that such a hard question but you know i can't answer that question for you. i can we plan example i was i think maybe 18 years old and are 19 and my brother is a couple years younger than me my dad is physically abusive and he was never there for us he was the type of father who just kind of came around my mom will let him whoop us or he'll show up whenever he wanted to but he wasn't obsessed and your father that was active in our lives and one particular time i guess my mom and told my dad that my brother was having company without permission and he went over there and you beat him up really bad the only reason i knew was because i was working for my mom at her hair salon and he brought them up they're black and blue and and bloody and i feel like i had a nervous breakdown i didn't handle that well i feel like i. i'll should have been there to protect them i hope i'm not going to cry cuz it still bothers me i feel like i should have been there to protect him and i wasn't and it bothers me and i take on a lot that bothers my wasn't there when it happened and i called social services and told them what happened and i just wish i would have took him to the hospital and i broke down and i just wish i would have been there for him and that bothers me and i just feel like i should have dealt with a better just took him to the hospital instead of going in the bathroom and crying. and that bothers the hell out of me to this day. just what i said about my brother. i just wish i was there for him when it happened. and i wasn't and i blame myself for it but i. i feel guilty about not being there for my ex-girlfriend. financial at the time i couldn't get to vegas so i couldn't be there for her when she was in hospital and sometimes you couldn't be there for me but it just i take a lot on my shoulders and i blame myself for stuff i know that i can't control but i feel guilty about that. barry. about that and so many other things my grandfather frank passed away and he was a great grandfather and i used to ask my family members when he was i don't know where he was located where he moved to new phone numbers anything and over the years i was asked what happened to him they need information and didn't tell me and then i found out years later that he passed away he was asking about me and i feel bad but i didn't know how to find him where he was so those are some of the things i feel bad for. tell me about the hardest.. it's a lot. i give you one a plan example. no i'm never served in the military at all but i can't give an example of something my mom she does hair like i said she has her own hair is what i want for karen hair salon i remember going to the shop one day just kind of hang out with her and she introduced me to a client of hers and i remember. the lady said oh i didn't realize you had a daughter i knew you had a son and this is the first time i heard that and it really got to me it hurt and i feel like there's no excuse for that and i didn't want her to explain and that just really hurt me to my callcore i talked to my dad about it i called him and he said i would just ignore it how do you ignore somebody saying that you don't even know that you exist how to ignore that and a part of me sometimes wish i could just erase a lot of things she's done like that away cuz it's still tends to bother me. i have no military experience i thought about in the past i thought about it since i actually got my degree in homeland security and investigation i thought about becoming a police officer there so many things i thought about getting into but the weather like freezes on certain positions i've applied for i just went a different direction to still have to do with the type of law enforcement like what i'm doing now but never got into that. i have no military experience i never signed up for the military just thought about it. are you happy. i'm kind of really never thought about it by happier i didn't enlist or not somewhat yeah. i'm happy with the way things are i don't think the military will actually be for me it's some good things about it like paying for college tuition always having to fall back on gi bill experience of you know fighting for your country but do i think that was for me i'm kind of past that at this point i think i'm past the age limit where you can even sign up for it so no i don't have any regrets. no. i have no experience in that so i don't know. i don't know if people that have been in the military like my family members uncles and aunties and dino that are still here or not here anymore. never been in the military so that's i can't answer that question. i don't know i just heard about it but people have been through after they come by the military but i have no idea. overstressed. happy at moments. feeling sometimes to feed it. and insecure hurt i spent a lot of time alone. is it by choice no but. good and bad. not great. yeah happy a lot of times when there's moments where i'm really really sad. is well too so they don't really balance each other out at all. not at all i do so much tossing and turning 4 years i don't remember last time i got a good amount of sleep until recently when i bought this brookstone pillow which is been helping but i'm still tossing and turning and then why can't i play there i want to go to sleep and it just does not happen and i don't know why if it's my stress or what's going on but my sleep patterns are not great and i still get up and do i have to do like i paid 9 hours or so so that's just me. active like i am now completely wide awake some days i'm fatigued and tired and a little sad but usually i'm just up and just being me and active and overly bubbly and a busybody. normally usually. yes in the past over 10 years ago i was diagnosed with that. yes. couple of days ago. i felt really happy. well sometimes you know in life because nobody's perfect and there's things i get to get out of it get to me sometimes you put the weight of the world on my shoulders and we take care of everybody else sometimes you get lost in that transition and i just seen i'm happy to have everyday i thank god for every day i live and i'm at i'm up and i'm able to work and do things that i need to do for myself and i do you spell happy and rested and i caught up on shows and i relax and i ate and i just had a good day of a peace and tranquility which is not. it's not a regular thing for me is kind of weird to have those kind of days cuz it's so much is going on. oh that's easy my grandmother. she's been passed away for about 20 years now 20-plus say she's been the backbone of who i am i'm so much like her as far as hard work and determined strong-willed i mean just the glue to keep the family together she was the backbone of our family and she's one of the she's my hero she did everything she you know she was so selfless she put everything on the back burner but everybody first you get what i mean because that's what i'm doing to i know i get that from her just you know endless caring and loving i never had to question that and my grandmother even she was a rare commodity a real real person of so much goodness and i just appreciate everything she taught me he would pay for our public school i'm sorry for a private school and help my mom and my dad when they first got married years and years ago with a second car will pick us up everyday everything she could to help and was there for everybody and then some she is a great example of a. but you know i'm a human being that went beyond the call of duty to do everything she could for her family and she's my hero and i'm really proud and honored to be a part of her bloodline and i miss her dearly. how is your best friend. i don't have one. but if they if i did have one i would say that would say that i'm a loving person i love hard that i'm creative and funny articulate down to earth very blunt a good friend and i value friendship you know and i made a mistake sometimes you piss me off i can be a little mean and be sarcastic but overall a good person that's just too hard on yourself. and doesn't get herself enough credit. and gets taken advantage of sometimes because of how nice i am. if i had one i was thinking it would say that. oh that's an easy one shopping i went to the mall and i shopped i shopped online i had so many packages coming from high heels tennis shoes to jackets and cute very creative sexy dresses so shopping puts my mind out of everything that we talked about as far as my feelings of hurt her insecurities all that goes away cuz shopping is therapeutic and once i get an idea in my mind and coordinating colors and i just know what i'm doing this and that with i'm very creative and in i like things out of the norm so that just makes me if i could shop all the time that would be a drink. nice thanks. my accomplishments with school me being out on my own for a long time i've been on my own since i was 18 19 years old and i've been able to keep up my own place and i'm very responsible i pay my bills before i do anything else for me and i am very particular about paying bills and that's just always been at the forefront to me to make sure to my house i was okay before i do anything else so i'm proud of my maturity level and my responsibilities.,1,1,5,0.058570713,0.9414293,,,,,633
42,218,go ahead and start a camcorder recording and then your answer. okay. all right. i'm not a therapist. i'm pleased. are you okay with this yes i am. i'm fine and yourself. where are you from originally. i'm from long beach california. i love the weather i love. different things that la has to offer like food and different events that they always have especially during the summer months. what are some things you don't really. i hate the traffic. you travel a lot. yes i do. i just love to experience new things this world has so many things to offer and i don't want to be juice in clothes in a box when there's so much out there that i can see. i'd like to hear about one of your trips. well. one of my trips that stands out the most was when i went to his israel. that's pretty much where god was born and. i got to see where the cross was where they laid his body after he was crucified so it was really am i opening experience. which one of your most. probably. probably seeing where. they sing the location where they had the cross where jesus was crucified was was probably the most memorable experience. i study criminal justice. what are you doing now. i do maintenance. then it is located in west la. what's your dream. my dream job honestly is to become a police officer. you consider yourself more shy or outgoing. when i was younger more shy but as i've gotten older i've grown out of that so now i consider myself more outgoing. why. i think that has come along with age because of with age comes more responsibility so you have to learn how to talk to people have to learn how to talk to different types of people and along with that the shyness kind of goes away by by default. tell me about your relationship with your family. oh man i can i honestly cannot ask for a better relationship with my family at all i have great parents i have great siblings i have four sisters everything about about them is great. sometimes when i'm feeling. i turn on the. to relax honestly will my favorite music artist sade so what i like to do is turn off the tv if it's hot out turn the fan on and i'll listen to some sade. how are you. very well actually i don't have a temper i've never had a temper so it's i find it quite easy to control it whenever i find myself getting mad but since i don't have have a temper it's pretty easy to control it. prop probably a week ago. yeah i would say about a week ago and it was with one of my co-workers because they felt that i treated them differently than my other co-workers which will actually is not the case. what's something you feel guilty about. sometimes i feel guilty when i come into work a few minutes late but i sign in as if i sign in on time for work. tell me about the hardest decision. the hardest decision i've ever had to make was deciding whether or not if i wanted to join the military. i change i would necessarily say i changed my mind but i was very curious about it but i wasn't sure but i made the decision to go even though it was scary. but that honestly was probably my hardest decision to make. tell me about an event or something that you wish you could have. okay what event was when i was i was very little and the church that i was going to have the time they had they had set up this event where a bus will come and pick up all the all the kids and take him to chuck e cheese. what ended up happening was the bus never never like never showed up so we were sitting there for literally about an hour and a half closer to ours and the bus never showed up and everybody was heartbroken. i know that's not really anything major but i mean i wish i could take take that away. have you ever. yes i have. when i join the military i was 21. to be honest i wanted a change in my life i wanted something different i feel like the military. would be a really great stepping stone just in life. as well as. they they help me pretty much pay for school so that and plus i got i got to travel so and and you know like it's always a great opportunity to serve my country you know. are you happy you did that. i am very happy that i that i join the navy yes. did you ever see combat i did not see any combat. honestly it was kind of a struggle it wasn't that easy at first. easy well i mean it wasn't difficult but it was a struggle. because it's two different lifestyles you know the natrol the military and civilian lifestyles are two completely different lifestyle so it was a lot more freedom going back and trying to the most difficult part was trying to find a job because i had came out right when the economy crashed so that was the most difficult part of my transition. to do after the military. i went to school and i had a student job at the. it changed me because i feel like it's giving me more driving life to go after the things that i want i feel like i'm slightly more and more discipline. honestly i feel like after i join the military i speak up for myself a lot more often. how have you been. lately i've been feeling great i don't have any complaints. i'm happy with my life so lately i've been feeling very happy and then satisfied. that's good. have you noticed any changes. not necessarily in my thoughts but in my behavior i'm finding that i'm taking more of a initiative with work and. you know i'm with my peers in my family. how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep. on a regular basis i find it pretty easy. when i don't sleep well i'm not really different i just feel like i have a little less energy throughout the day but that's really the only difference i i'm i'm still the same person. no i have not. okay. have you been diagnosed. no i have not. when was the last. the last time i fell really happy was probably when i got my paycheck yesterday. someone has been a positive influence in my life probably my father he's always putting me in the in in the right direction now i'm here he's always. give me some great advice just about things of things in life in general you know so i can always go to him. how do your best. my best friend would describe me as funny outgoing nice. sincere. yeah. something i've done recently
