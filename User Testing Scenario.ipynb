    "#### Scenario Overview\n",
    "Participants will use an online platform to process anonymized transcripts of patient interviews, uploaded as anonymized patient text data. Using an ML model trained on prior data, the tool will process this test data, analyzing language patterns associated with depressive symptoms. Participants will work with different interpretable ML models (IML), each providing insights to help clinicians understand the basis of each prediction. They will then assess their trust in the ML modelâ€™s results based on these insights and determine which IML model best explained the prediction and enhanced their trust in it."
