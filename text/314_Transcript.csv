816.4,826.5, probably basically the same I think I might complain the bit like oh I'm tired or my body hurts or whatever you know but I think overall I'm probably the same,0.9166487455368042
828.3,838.2, my kids know I'll be there I'll tell my get though I'm really tired and they'll understand like my older daughter will be really helpful and letting my the. I will try to cook dinner or something like that so that you know,0.9284536838531494

917.4,933.8, in this case some of the kids have tried to harm themselves or whatever so that's the focus of the therapy and it's been really good my husband and I both have been going with our daughter and it's been really really informational and really helpful I think,0.9772716164588928
939.0,948.6, oh my God I was she was in a bad way she was being all suffering a lot and we knew it and we acted on it that's all,0.9298141002655029
961.0,961.5, like,0.963597297668457

968.5,974.7, probably would be in Israel when we renewed our marriage vows in the the ethic in Cana,0.9250515699386597
976.0,992.0, so you know where the wedding of Cana took place that was really moving and beautiful and it was it happened that our anniversary was we left on our anniversary day we flew to Israel on so it was right at the same time it was beautiful,0.9236728549003601
993.5,1010.3, find meaningful and other than that I would say you know like other joyful occasions have been you don't like Christmas and you know family gatherings and you know my dad's birthday turned 83 on Christmas Eve you know that kind of think so,0.8996860980987549
1022.3,1025.3, that's an interesting question I would say,0.9698002338409424
1028.2,1036.1, once I get like things done that I need to do like if I'm have a lot of a lot of either work to do around the house or,0.9765329360961914

1042.8,1048.7, you know much like I mean I worked for many years in it as an administrative manager at UCLA and,0.8968034386634827
1050.3,1064.2, you don't want to get a project done or you get your whatever month-end stuff done or there's a lot of different things that have to meet deadlines or so that feeling of like yeah I got it done you know so I think that would be a no for me the most,0.9434396028518677
1065.8,1072.5, most recent way of feeling good and feeling you know like feeling accomplished,0.9666288495063782
1077.5,1078.8, dream job,0.9400947093963623
1081.6,1112.8, I think I've already lived it I'm also a birth Doula and yeah and so I've attended a lot of Earth and now I really only do it for family and friends and it's the most rewarding thing you could possibly ask to be involved in is the birth of bringing a new life into this world so I would say that's probably was my was a dream job and I didn't know what I trained much after you know I did my managerial stuff and,0.9673959016799927
1114.0,1121.8, with all it is and was awesome so I don't work at a hospital anymore actually the hospital that I work at is now closed but,0.9028682708740234
1123.2,1124.7, but like I said it for family and friends,0.8502516746520996
1127.9,1164.1, I attended a friend of mine's Birth by accident she up she happen to have the same old BS I did with all my children and I came to bring food for her husband when she was in labor we were freaking out close friends and you know her labor picked up quite a bit when I got there she wanted me to say she didn't want me to leave I hadn't planned on it so that was the first birthday I attended outside of it you know myself giving birth which is a whole different experience so after that it was really interesting and interested in possibly setting nurse-midwifery,0.9546566605567932
1165.0,1175.6, but then I discovered this thing called being a doula which is really gives you even a lot more Hands-On one-on-one contact with the patient which is what I like,0.9803750514984131
1176.7,1186.7, so I tried to do that at the hospital in Inglewood about 15 years ago cuz my son is 15 and he was a year Old Mill 16 years ago so,0.8811736702919006
1188.4,1190.6, yeah and I've been,0.9614418745040894
1192.4,1223.1, well it can be challenging in terms of hours it depends on how long the woman is in labor but and you know also like for me I always tell my friends and family if they want me to be there dual that I cannot guarantee 100% I'm not doing it for business and that way and because of that I don't have like backup doulas that in case I'm sick or I'm not available somebody else could fill in for me so but so far it's been that all the women that have asked me I've been able to be there for some reason still there,0.9627667665481567
1225.1,1244.7, the the only one that I missed was one A friend of mine from church who wanted me to go with her second baby I was with her for her first but her labor went so fast you didn't call me in the middle of the night and she was like two hours of Labor she would even if it called me I would have been there in time so I went really fast but other than that you know,0.9597954750061035
1247.1,1251.1, yeah I've been I've been able to attend all the verse of people that have asked me to do,0.8998710513114929
1258.3,1261.2, all of life or in your job,0.8426312208175659
1263.4,1268.3, probably might my own births I mean my the birth of my own children,0.9032662510871887
1272.1,1275.0, like there's an extreme,0.9739570617675781
1276.0,1295.7, sense of Joy excitement relief because of course you're out of the pain and then like it's just it's just a matter of you know going forward from there but it's it's like something you can explain it's just it's awesome after you give birth so,0.9477462768554688
1296.8,1307.7, and I've experienced both ways I've done both natural and I at my last job was a spy a C-section so I've had both both experiences,0.8831397891044617
1318.5,1329.2, all right with my Fairchild had kind of a crazy nurse she was a little psychotic but other than that we laugh about it now but when I was in labor it wasn't funny and she,0.9303385019302368
1330.3,1334.8, she was not there when the doctor I mean it was my third child was,0.8932109475135803
1335.8,1357.1, born very quickly after he broke the water and wolf my husband was there but she was not in there with the doctor and she got in a lot of trouble because I only had like two contractions after that and my daughter was born in the bed so for me it was great cuz I didn't have to go through any of the labor but I'm sure they weren't happy that you fill out a lot of paperwork after that,0.9619774222373962
1358.1,1358.6, so,0.8641213178634644
1365.8,1368.8, now what I get myself for 10 or 20 years ago,0.9442124962806702
1375.0,1381.5, 10 or 20 years ago is probably more not as some relaxed not as,0.9377039074897766
1383.4,1385.2, like I feeling out my age that,0.9198024868965149
1388.8,1421.6, I don't have the same concerns that I did then it's I don't worry about I don't worry at all about what people think about me I don't worry at all about what you know you know like why I noticed my daughters on Mom you can't wear that because people are going to say this I said I don't care you know but they do because it's still in their frame of mind that owe mom you have to dress like this or just like that or whatever so that would probably be at the wisdom that you you achieve with AIDs that you do see how life there's so many things that are more important in life than worrying about little things,0.9695795178413391
1428.8,1429.8, most proud of,0.9770253896713257
1432.5,1461.7, probably my family like my husband and my my children I mean the fact that we've stayed married that we weren't intact family that my kids see every day how their friends suffer who who come from divorced families or single parents and they they actually Express gratitude sometimes that we are married and we still you know we are still a family so I would say that's probably it,0.9558478593826294
1471.2,1486.8, probably the one of my best qualities is being able to listen to people and being able to not be judgemental through the years I've had a lot of experience with,0.9647473096847534
1489.1,1510.4, people with problems lot of friends with problems people I know from church and it's just taught me that everybody has weaknesses everybody has problems and I don't think I'm better than someone else if you think you're better than someone else and that's usually to me a sign that you don't know yourself well enough,0.9584425687789917
1515.8,1516.4, okay,0.9752396941184998
1520.8,1521.3, okay,0.975234866142273
