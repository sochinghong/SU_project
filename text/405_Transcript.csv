436.1,442.6, and yeah yeah so that that's not good relationship with the husband but,0.8833960890769958
444.3,448.8, but since we have determined that we need to divorce,0.9842275977134705
450.7,456.9, we don't expect anything out of each other so we don't argue as much so that's good,0.9538342952728271
468.9,469.7, well,0.7964692115783691

510.3,518.8, well you know we were married and I wasn't content I guess you could say and,0.98455810546875
520.2,527.1, I kind of just gave up on our relationship and now that I look back I think it's because,0.9796954989433289
528.8,571.3, I want children and he would have been happy to never have any and so since I didn't have a father it was very important that I create children with someone who really wanted to be a father and so I was kind of at an age where I needed to start thinking about having children yet I was with someone who really was not into it so that I think that's one maybe the core reason why I was not content and I just felt like this marriage isn't going to work n so you know we went to therapy and everything and he did not want to break up and,0.9715978503227234
574.6,580.9, and I had to leave him because I just wasn't happy and that was that was very hard cuz,0.9207024574279785
582.5,582.9, yeah,0.882328987121582
584.3,597.6, felt like I was hurting him which which I was him he survived he got over and now he's married with two kids but it was hard to leave him,0.9347763657569885
601.5,605.2, tell me about Nevada or something that you wish you could erase from your memory,0.9779057502746582

621.3,624.6, I'm sure there's something well,0.9756974577903748
626.5,628.0, yeah there's some,0.9582797884941101
629.9,638.5, I guess it'd be nice to erase from my memory a recent I'm not resend but an event in my,0.9025784730911255
639.5,645.3, recent adulthood here in Culver City where one of my best friends,0.9630321860313416
649.1,663.9, betrayed me by back years ago when my husband first got into real estate she and her family were growing and they really need a larger home and,0.9438601732254028
666.8,677.3, we just assumed that you know that they would use my husband as their agent supposed to sell their current home current at the time and purchase a new home,0.918599009513855
678.4,691.2, and as it turned out they surprised us and had been talking to this other local agent and yeah that was devastating,0.9485759139060974
692.5,703.9, I don't think I've ever been betrayed like that so I wish I could erase that not cuz now you know this was back when the kids were really young,0.9647120237350464
705.2,706.0, and,0.8967347741127014
707.5,711.3, my daughter at the time my youngest daughter was let's say,0.9611790180206299
712.5,713.8, 6 Maybe,0.7614572644233704
714.7,774.0, maybe five anyway her and my best friend's daughter are the same age they were born within days of each other we were pregnant together and they were really tight those two little girls and they ended up not going to the same elementary school so they didn't get to hang out during those years but every time we run into them in the neighborhood are they run into each other at a summer camp or something they were just so connected they were just you know like two peas in a pod even those her their moms weren't talking to each other anymore so now they're 13 and 14 and they're in middle school together and they're still very connected in fact she she for the first time spent the night at our house last night with my daughter and another girl and it's just a little awkward you know cuz now these girls are becoming really good friends,0.9755952954292297
774.6,779.3, your friends and yet I still have this,0.8799519538879395
786.7,789.3, bad memory of what her,0.9417605400085449
791.7,793.9, her mom did to to me,0.9129310846328735
795.8,798.4, that was about 1:10,0.6776770949363708
799.7,800.7, about 8 years ago,0.8008599281311035
804.4,810.2, I tried it I try to ignore it and put it out of my head which have been able to,0.9382544159889221
811.8,812.8, in recent years,0.9803872108459473
814.3,816.4, but obviously it still comes up,0.9681733846664429
818.9,821.4, anyway that was that,0.7337275743484497
827.8,848.4, not that easy I do sometimes get a decent night's sleep but sometimes it's hard to get to sleep and most of the time I wake up and can't get back to sleep but or I finally get back to sleep and then it's almost time to get up you know that that difficult thing,0.9595442414283752
853.5,861.1, well the waking up in the middle of the night is definitely triggered by having to go to the bathroom and then,0.9701022505760193
863.9,868.4, you know it's not always that easy to get back to sleep and then I wake up again to go to the bathroom,0.9590297341346741
870.6,886.0, so I guess that's the trigger as far as getting to sleep having a hard time there I don't know I think there's just too much on my mind running through my mind and the day I feel like I haven't accomplished enough during the day so,0.9680483341217041
887.8,893.1, it's hard for me to just go to sleep when I'm supposed to guess,0.9542665481567383
903.5,911.8, well I'm kind of used to it now so I just go on to the day probably looking looking tired and,0.9345402121543884
914.1,931.9, like I'm kind of used to feeling tired I just do what I need to do and sometimes if I'm able to if I'm at home and don't have huge commitments yeah I might just like I said earlier just take a nap or something read my book watch TV whatever,0.9614395499229431
938.4,941.1, lately have I been feeling,0.8046882748603821
945.1,946.0, kind of down,0.9531572461128235
947.3,949.2, on myself down on life,0.9387184977531433
956.6,962.9, well I have this pending need for separation / divorce,0.9690424203872681
966.2,974.0, I'm worried that I made a lot of mistakes with my girls now they're teenagers you know on the verge of adulthood,0.9712897539138794
977.7,989.3, and so I worried that you know I did all kinds of things wrong with their guidance in their early childhood and now it's too late,0.9669699668884277
990.6,994.2, like I missed out on a lot of things,0.9861613512039185
998.2,1013.6, and yeah I need a job I'm unemployed I don't know what I want to do with my life I know I want to do something and I just wish you know I never did finish college unfortunately because I was traveling and stuff,0.9541425704956055
1014.9,1018.2, so I regret that extremely,0.890936553478241
1020.1,1025.2, and I need to get a job and be able to take care of myself cuz I need to,0.9811229705810547
1026.8,1038.7, divorce and move on with my life so now I forget what the original question was but that's the state part of the state of Mo,0.956901490688324
1043.5,1044.0, no,0.9382410049438477
1046.9,1047.5, yes,0.9938145279884338
1052.3,1054.5, well,0.9876290559768677
1055.5,1059.1, the first time or or or recently,0.9488556981086731
1061.4,1074.1, the first time I guess was you know when I was in my early twenties I was just a little upset about constantly that was another breakup I had to make back then I was,0.9512829184532166
1076.1,1082.9, in my early twenties and I needed to break up with my boyfriend but again it was very upsetting cuz I,0.9842149615287781
1084.5,1092.2, you know it's hard because he didn't want to break up and I feel like I was hurting him and I didn't understand this feeling I was really upset,0.9633925557136536
1093.9,1103.2, how did that was my first time having depression so I didn't really recognize it as depression but I went somehow I had the,0.9198251366615295
1104.2,1118.9, knowledge or the I was able to take myself to a psychiatrist I remember I paid for her by the hour and she prescribed Xanax to just help relax me,0.9500536322593689
1120.1,1133.3, and so I guess that helped me get through that and then I've had depression throughout the years just so you know little bits here and there for various reasons such as I guess it's usually a relationship you know,0.944672167301178
1136.8,1145.9, yeah so the most recent time I was diagnosed and put on meds that was probably about 2 years ago,0.9410489201545715

1155.1,1164.6, money and I don't have insurance otherwise yeah I'd be happy to go to therapy anything that might help,0.9709286689758301

1185.4,1188.3, I don't know I guess maybe,0.9869781136512756
1191.0,1192.7, when my children were born,0.9854082465171814
1204.0,1210.4, I guess happy I just you know I always wanted children so it's nice,0.9483092427253723
1211.5,1212.4, to have them,0.9737468957901001
1213.6,1222.5, that's I don't know that's all I can remember of that and I guess I don't remember the good times too well I remember the bad times,0.9197482466697693
1226.4,1228.5, something you did recently that you really enjoy,0.9473183155059814
1234.5,1237.4, something I did that I really enjoyed,0.9857192635536194
1245.9,1246.6, well,0.9765529036521912
1250.0,1251.5, that's the way I am,0.8319473266601562
1253.6,1261.0, Friday night I went to a friend's house and met up with five other girlfriends and we,0.9370591044425964
1262.0,1270.8, we created vision boards and talked and had dinner at one of their house that was that was fun,0.9817336201667786
1275.9,1276.7, we get to,0.9176693558692932
1285.5,1287.6, stay in college get my degree,0.969740092754364
1292.8,1296.4, get therapy trying to become happy,0.96014803647995
1305.0,1308.8, yeah try to figure out things earlier in life,0.9809821844100952
1310.5,1311.1, like,0.961501955986023
1313.2,1313.6, yeah,0.9021990299224854
1316.4,1324.8, stay in college and and mainly I think the mean and what it all boils down to no matter what your depressed about it seems like,0.896888256072998
1326.0,1328.3, as soon as the saying goes in the,0.8096898198127747
1330.2,1335.4, songs go you know it's all about money the world revolves around money in,0.9784627556800842
1336.6,1378.6, having none that in itself is for depressing so besides relationships and different things that have happened in your life having no money as you know it's like you can't even try to fix anything because you don't have the money to fix it so with that in mind I would definitely advise myself to get my college degree and to get a job and stick with it don't quit to go traveling and I'll just stick with a job sick with a company build up your seniority keep your benefits,0.9645431637763977
1380.0,1389.4, and build up some knowledge or some expertise in some sort of filled yeah that would have been my biggest piece of advice to myself,0.9690006971359253
1396.3,1397.9, not much,0.9745882153511047
1402.6,1403.3, I guess,0.9752998352050781

1415.7,1437.7, aren't even able to do that you know and they try so hard or they look back on their life and they wish they had done it so that's the one thing I mean I wanted five children and I always wanted a boy which I never had but I guess that's the biggest thing I can think of to be proud of,0.96451336145401
1439.0,1441.1, having my two daughters,0.9630683660507202
1449.9,1451.3, I'm a very loyal,0.9811606407165527
