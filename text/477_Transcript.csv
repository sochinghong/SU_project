1094.3,1140.6, so I heard this piece of advice the other day and or this thing and then I thought it's really profound and I wish that I had read it back then which is when you think about buying something instead of thinking oh here's this beautiful coat it's $100 I want it I'm going to buy it I don't think of it is costing $100 think of it is costing 10 times that because that's effectively what your money could do if you didn't spend it on that coat but instead invested it you know intelligently you would have 10 times that much money eventually so you should really think about it in those terms and I think I've been much more consumer than a saber and so I wish that I had to been more aware of that 10 or 20 years ago,0.9697237014770508
