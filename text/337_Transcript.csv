638.8,640.9, the last thing I could think of was,0.9775009155273438
642.9,670.8, a argued with my husband about the care of my mother-in-law cuz she's got dementia and so we were the reason we came out here from the Inland Empire with take care of her she won't go anywhere but LA and she is like hardcore Angelino like we know we are that wear that in our nature but we also know it's cheaper to live elsewhere but so we came out here to take care of her,0.950471818447113
671.8,729.0, and he wants her to be able to stay in her in her apartment and I want her to move in with us because it would be cheaper and faster and easier and safer for her if she lived with us but she wants to stay where she is cuz she can't see that there's inherent danger now because of the disease process but he wants her to stay where she he wants her to be able to have what you want cuz he's a mama's boy like I am I'm a mama's girl you know I lost my mom like four years ago I'm still a mama's girl and I'll standing still and I know that it brings you a sense of satisfaction to carry out their wishes because you care about them so much that's what they wants you want to get it for him and because you don't they you know that happened when you were going up with me try to give you what you want because you wanted it and you want to do that for them now they started giving back to them somebody that you care about me you feel deserves it,0.9684644937515259
729.9,781.0, but it's kind of dangerous for you know I don't want this thing to happen to her yet I want her to remain who she is for as long as you can so I know it seems that she has is going to erase who she is eventually and eventually she will have to be put in a place where they can give a 24-hour medically trained care but until then we can we can handle it you know amongst ourselves it's not that bad but it's getting where she really should has no business living by herself anymore so the solution right now is he stays there most of time with her and I go back to our house and it gets stressful and it gets annoying because it's I do I handle the outside things are run the errand to take her to the store things like that he does the day-to-day things make sure she has she eats make sure she has clean clothes things like that,0.9714965224266052
782.3,785.0, so me it's a partnership it to its,0.823145866394043
